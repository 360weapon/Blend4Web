\index{Blend4Web}

\section{What's Blend4Web}
\label{about:about-product}\label{about:blend4web}\label{about:index-0}
Blend4Web is a web-oriented 3D engine - a software framework for authoring and interactive rendering of three-dimensional graphics and audio in browsers.

The platform is intended for visualizations, presentations, online-shops, games and other rich internet applications.

The Blend4Web framework is integrated tightly with Blender - a 3D modeling and animation tool (hence the name). The content is rendered by means of WebGL and other browser technologies, without the use of plugins.

Technically Blend4Web is a library for web pages, a Blender addon and some tools for debugging and optimization.

The Blend4Web 3D engine has been developed by Triumph LLC employees since 2010. The engine was first released on March 28 2014.

\index{engine}

\section{About Engines}
\label{about:about-engine}\label{about:id2}\label{about:index-1}
An engine is a separate part of software code which is used by external applications for implementing the required functionality.

Engine examples are: site engine, blog engine, online shop engine, wiki engine, search egine, game engine etc. The economical reason for the existance of software engines is multiple usage of the same functionality. For example developers may create relatively cheap online shops or games using one or another engine.

\index{graphics engine}\index{three-dimensional engine}

\section{Graphics Engine, Game Engine}
\label{about:about-graphics-engine}\label{about:id3}\label{about:index-2}
A graphics engine performs special functions in displaying graphics. It is an intermediary between:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
high-level application part (game logic, business logic) and

\item {} 
low-level system part (for example, the graphics library {\hyperref[about:about-webgl]{\emph{WebGL}}} and underlying {\hyperref[about:about-drivers-video-cards]{\emph{drivers}}}).

\end{itemize}

A graphics engine may be combined with the sound system, the physics engine, the artificial intelligence system, the networking system and the scene and logic editors producing a \textbf{three-dimensional engine} - an integrated environment for authoring 3D applications.

\index{WebGL}

\section{What's WebGL}
\label{about:webgl}\label{about:about-webgl}\label{about:index-3}
WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is one of the modern browser technologies which allows authoring 3D graphics applications. In other words WebGL is ``3D in a browser''.

\index{Blender}

\section{What's Blender}
\label{about:index-6}\label{about:about-blender}\label{about:blender}
Blender is a popular piece of software for 3D modeling and animation and is free and open source. Models and scenes which are created in this software can be displayed, for example, by means of a {\hyperref[about:about-graphics-engine]{\emph{three-dimensional engine}}} on a web page.

\index{3D Modeling}

\section{3D Modeling}
\label{about:about-modelling}\label{about:index-7}\label{about:d}
Authoring graphics resources requires trained specialists - 3D artists.

A typical workflow may include the following stages:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
choosing photos and/or creating concepts and sketches (views from the front - from the side - from the above) of the future model or scene

\item {} 
modeling - a 3D model consisting of polygons is created

\item {} 
UV mapping - the model is unwrapped for further overlaying of textures (flat images)

\item {} 
texturing - textures are overlayed on the 3D model

\item {} 
materials setup - materials are assigned for different parts of the model and tuned (for example, a wooden door with a metal handle)

\item {} 
rigging - the controlling elements (``skeletal bones'') are attached to the model to animate it

\item {} 
animation - the model is set in motion to visualize actions for example - of characters

\item {} 
export - can be performed on any stage to display the 3D model in its final form, for example, on a web page

\end{itemize}

In addition, realism improving techniques are often used in the process of creating 3D models which require additional stages:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
creating a high-poly model - a detailed version of the model is created

\item {} 
``baking'' of a normal map - details from the high-poly model are transferred to the main model in the form of a special texture (normal map)

\item {} 
creating a specular map - different reflection color and ratio are assigned to different model parts

\item {} 
baking environment maps - is performed to visualize the surrounding environment reflection on the model surface

\item {} 
setting up the camera and the light sources on the scene

\item {} 
physical simulation parameters setup - particles, cloth

\end{itemize}

The time required to author 3D models and animation depends on their complexity and required quality and may vary from 1-2 days (for example a game item) to 1-2 weeks (for example a detailed aircraft model) and even to several months (realistic characters with clothing, hair, face sets, with animation and figure parameters setup).

\index{browser technologies}\index{browser}

\section{Browser Technologies}
\label{about:id10}\label{about:index-8}\label{about:about-browser-tech}
Browser is a program for viewing Internet content. At the dawn of Internet technologies the browser's role was to view text pages with the inclusion of static images (``hyper-text''). Modern browsers are full-scale platforms for multimedia web applications.

Among the already implemented and promising browser features which are used in {\hyperref[about:about-product]{\emph{Blend4Web}}} the following technologies can be noted:

\index{interactive graphics}

\section{Interactive Graphics}
\label{about:about-interactive-graphics}\label{about:id12}\label{about:index-9}
Applied to computer graphics the term ``interactive'' means that the user can interact with a constantly changing image. For example the user can change the view direction in a 3D scene, move the objects, trigger animation and carry out other actions normally associated with computer games.

Graphics interactivity is achieved by utilizing a frequent change of images, so the user action (for example a mouse movement or the pressing of a key) between frames leads to the image changing in the next frame. Images must replace each other so frequently that the human eye could not recognize them individually (at least 30 frames per second).

``Real-time graphics'' or ``real-time rendering'' are also similar in meaning to the term.

\index{video card}\index{drivers}

\section{Video Cards and Drivers}
\label{about:id13}\label{about:about-drivers-video-cards}\label{about:index-10}
Interactive graphics is provided by a special-purpose hardware part of modern computers so called graphics processor which can be implemeted as a discrete device (video card) or as a part of the central processing unit.

Main graphics processors vendors for desktop computers are:  - NVidia (GeForce, Quadro), AMD (Radeon), Intel (HD), for embedded devices - ARM (Mali), PowerVR (SGX), Nvidia (Tegra), Qualcomm (Adreno) (trade marks are specified in brackets).

Program access to graphics processor resources is carried out via an intermediate program called driver. It's important for the correct working of interactive graphics programs to have drivers of the latest version in the system. Drivers can be installed (or upgraded) from corresponding websites of graphics processors vendors. See detailed info in the section {\hyperref[problems_and_solutions:webgl-not-working]{\emph{WebGL Failed to Init}}}.

\chapter{Quick Install}
\label{first_steps:quick-install}\label{first_steps::doc}\label{first_steps:id1}
Quick install of the Blend4Web addon suits Blender artists who have no need in full-scale 3D applications development. In this case the main benefit is the opportunity to export a scene into a single HTML file for viewing in WebGL-capable browsers.

For more serious tasks an {\hyperref[setup:setup]{\emph{SDK}}} setup is required.


\section{Installing Blender}
\label{first_steps:quick-install-blender}\label{first_steps:blender}
Authoring 3D scenes is carried out directly in \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender\_(software)}{Blender} which is open source software and is distributed free of charge.

A current stable version of Blender should be used. It can be downloaded from the \href{http://www.blender.org/download}{official site}.

{\hfill\includegraphics[width=1.000\linewidth]{blender_first_run.jpg}\hfill}

\index{export!Blender installation}

\section{The Engine Addon Install}
\label{first_steps:quick-install-addon}\label{first_steps:id4}\label{first_steps:index-0}
Run Blender, load the default scene \code{File \textgreater{} New}. Open the user preferences \code{File \textgreater{} User Preferences...}. Under the \code{Addons} tab click \code{Install from File...} and then select the zip archive with the addon files. After that turn on the \code{Import-Export: Blend4Web}  checkbox.

{\hfill\includegraphics[width=1.000\linewidth]{user_preferences_install_b2w.jpg}\hfill}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}

Then click \code{Save User Settings} and close the user preferences window.

\index{export!addon installation}

\section{Exporting and Viewing Scenes}
\label{first_steps:quick-install-export-viewer}\label{first_steps:id5}\label{first_steps:index-1}
The created scenes can be exported in HTML format. To do this use the \code{File \textgreater{} Export \textgreater{} Blend4Web (.html)} menu option and choose the export filepath. The resulting HTML file can be opened with any browser with WebGL support.

\section{Upgrading the Addon}
\label{first_steps:id6}\label{first_steps:quick-install-addon-upgrade}\label{first_steps:index-2}
To upgrade the addon \textbf{first disable the old version and then remove it}.

To disable the addon: run Blender, load the default scene \code{File \textgreater{} New}. Open the user preferences \code{File \textgreater{} User Preferences...}. Go to the \code{Addons} tab and choose the \code{Import-Export} category. Disable the \code{Import-Export: Blend4Web} checkbox. Then click \code{Save User Settings} and \textbf{restart Blender}.

Then to remove the addon open the user preferences window again, expand the Blend4Web info panel and click the \code{Remove} button.

{\hfill\includegraphics[width=1.000\linewidth]{user_preferences_disable_addon.jpg}\hfill}

\chapter{Development Environment Setup}
\label{setup:setup}\label{setup::doc}\label{setup:id1}
This setup option suits 3D application developers. To familiarize yourself with the Blend4Web addon {\hyperref[first_steps:quick-install]{\emph{quick install}}} can be a better option.

In order to work you must have the engine distribution, a browser (suitable for local viewing) and Blender (with the addon installed).


\section{Distribution Installation}
\label{setup:getting-started-distribution}\label{setup:id2}
Stable versions of the distribution are available as an archive (\code{blend4web\_sdk\_free.zip} -- free SDK, \code{blend4web\_sdk\_pro.zip} -- commercial SDK). Simply unpack this archive somewhere.

The distribution consists of the engine's source code, the minified version for applications, the Blender scripts, the source blend-files, the exported scenes, textures and sound files (see detailed {\hyperref[developers:repo-file-structure]{\emph{repository structure}}}).

\index{browser!setup}

\section{Choosing a Browser}
\label{setup:index-0}\label{setup:getting-started-browser}\label{setup:id3}
The engine requires a {\hyperref[about:browser-webgl-support]{\emph{browser with WebGL support}}}. Just to check it open the page \href{http://get.webgl.org/}{http://get.webgl.org/}. The green message and rotating cube should appear:

{\hfill\includegraphics[width=1.000\linewidth]{browser_supports_webgl.jpg}\hfill}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] 
\end{DUlineblock}


\section{Setting up the Browser for Loading Local Resources}
\label{setup:browser-for-local-loading}\label{setup:id4}
The engine's renderer is a web application and it works when you view an HTML file in a browser. After initialization the resources (scenes, textures) are loaded. This process is subject to the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin\_policy}{same-origin policy} rule. In particular this rule forbids loading from a local directory. A simple way to bypass this limitation is to set up the browser for loading local resources (recommended). Another way is to use a {\hyperref[problems_and_solutions:local-web-server]{\emph{local web server}}}.

\begin{notice}{note}{Note:}
It is recommended to use such browser only for viewing local content because changing the default settings can damage security.
\end{notice}

\emph{Chrome under MS Windows}:

Right click on the browser shortcut, select the \code{Properties} option and add the \code{-{-}allow-file-access-from-files} option to the executable filepath (after the space symbol). Click \code{ОК}.

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] 
\end{DUlineblock}

{\hfill\includegraphics[width=1.000\linewidth]{chrome_file_access.jpg}\hfill}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] 
\end{DUlineblock}

For convenience create a copy of the shortcut and modify it for local viewing while leaving the original shortcut untouched for normal surfing.

\emph{Chrome/Chromium under Linux}:

Run the browser with the parameter:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZgt{} google\PYGZhy{}chrome \PYGZhy{}\PYGZhy{}allow\PYGZhy{}file\PYGZhy{}access\PYGZhy{}from\PYGZhy{}files
\end{Verbatim}

or:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZgt{} chromium\PYGZhy{}browser \PYGZhy{}\PYGZhy{}allow\PYGZhy{}file\PYGZhy{}access\PYGZhy{}from\PYGZhy{}files
\end{Verbatim}

\emph{Firefox under MS Windows/Linux}:

Enter \textbf{about:config} to the browser's address bar, search for the \code{security.fileuri.strict\_origin\_policy} parameter and double-click on it to switch from \code{true} to \code{false}.

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] 
\end{DUlineblock}

\index{viewer!launch}

\section{Running The Scenes Viewer}
\label{setup:id6}\label{setup:getting-started-launching-viewer}\label{setup:index-1}
Open the \code{apps\_dev/viewer/viewer\_dev.html} file in a set up browser. The page with the renderer window and interface elements should be displayed.

{\hfill\includegraphics[width=1.000\linewidth]{default_page.jpg}\hfill}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] 
\end{DUlineblock}

\begin{notice}{note}{Note:}
If the page isn't displayed correctly, or an error message is shown, follow the instructions described in the {\hyperref[problems_and_solutions:renderer-not-working]{\emph{Problems when Running the Renderer}}} section.
\end{notice}

\index{Blender!installation}

\section{Engine Addon Installation}
\label{setup:getting-started-addon}\label{setup:id7}\label{setup:index-2}
\begin{notice}{note}{Note:}
It is recommended to remove the addon first if it was originally installed using {\hyperref[first_steps:quick-install]{\emph{quick install}}}.
\end{notice}

Run Blender, load the default scene \code{File \textgreater{} New} (hot keys \code{Ctrl-N}). Open the user preferences window \code{File \textgreater{} User Preferences...} (hot keys \code{Ctrl-Alt-U}). Under the \code{File} tab in the \code{Scripts} field choose the path to the \code{blender\_scripts} directory.

{\hfill\includegraphics[width=1.000\linewidth]{user_preferences_scripts_path.jpg}\hfill}

Click \code{Save User Settings} and restart Blender.

\begin{notice}{note}{Note:}
Instead of this it's possible to copy the scripts directory \code{blender\_scripts/addons/blend4web} to the already used directory for scripts or even to the installation directory, for example:

\code{C:\textbackslash{}Program Files\textbackslash{}Blender Foundation\textbackslash{}Blender\textbackslash{}2.70\textbackslash{}scripts\textbackslash{}addons\textbackslash{}blend4web}.
\end{notice}

Again load the default scene, open the user preferences window, go to the \code{Addons} tab and choose the \code{Import-Export} category. Enable the \code{Import-Export: Blend4Web} checkbox.

{\hfill\includegraphics[width=1.000\linewidth]{user_preferences_enable_addon.jpg}\hfill}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] 
\end{DUlineblock}

Click \code{Save User Settings}. Restarting Blender isn't required.

\emph{For checking:}

In the \code{File \textgreater{} Export} menu the \code{Blend4Web (.json)} and \code{Blend4Web (.html)} options should appear. Also the operators should appear in the search box when searching for ``B4W'' (hot key \code{SPACE}).


\subsection{Enabling the HTML export option}
\label{setup:html}
The \code{Blend4Web (.html)} option in the \code{File \textgreater{} Export} menu is not active by default contrary to the standalone version of the addon (see {\hyperref[first_steps:quick-install]{\emph{Quick Install}}}).

If required (for example for HTML export debugging) this option can be enabled. To do this specify the path to the \code{embed} application build of the distribution in the \code{Path to b4w source} field. The standard path relative to the engine's root is \code{external/deploy/apps/embed}.

{\hfill\includegraphics[width=1.000\linewidth]{user_preferences_enable_addon_HTML_option.jpg}\hfill}


\chapter{Workflow}
\label{workflow::doc}\label{workflow:working-process-stages}\label{workflow:id1}
Developing any product is a creative process with many participants who have different skills and experience. However no matter how complex it is and what is the target it's always possible to separate the production stage in which the bulk of assets and source code is authored.

When using Blend4Web the workflow is the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {} 
Preparing a 3D scene in Blender.

\item {} 
Exporting the resources in a format suitable for the engine.

\item {} 
Running, tweaking and debugging the scene in the viewer.

\item {} 
Creating the target application.

\end{enumerate}


\section{Preparing the Scenes}
\label{workflow:id2}
Besides the usual stages such as modeling, texturing, animation etc a scene should be prepared for working in the engine.

General recommendations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {} 
Blend-files should be located in the \code{external/blender/project\_name} directory.

\item {} 
Texture and sound files should be external and located in the \code{external/deploy/assets/project\_name} directory.

\item {} 
Auxiliary files which are not intended for loading into the engine (for example, references), should be located in the \code{external/blender/project\_name} directory.

\item {} 
The file from which export will occur should only contain models required for the application being developed.

\item {} 
Object, mesh, material, texture, armature etc should have distinct names (in English). They should not be named ``Cube.001'', ``Material'', ``Armature''.

\item {} 
Its possible to link components from other (library) files.

\end{enumerate}

\index{export}

\section{Exporting Scenes}
\label{workflow:index-0}\label{workflow:id3}
In order to load scenes authored in Blender into the engine you have to transform them into the format suitable for reading by a browser. At the moment text files with \code{.json} extension are used in which exported data structures are saved in the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. This file, in turn, refers to one binary file with a \code{.bin} extension containing data arrays of models and to external resources - textures and sound samples.

While the \code{.json} and \code{.bin} files are created upon export, texture and sound files are normally placed by hand (there is an exception though: resources embeded into a \code{.blend}-file are placed automatically).

Export can be performed by choosing the \code{Blend4Web (.json)} option from the \code{File \textgreater{} Export} menu. For quick access search for \code{b4w export} (hot key \code{SPACE}).

It is recommended to place files intended for export into the directory intended for application deployment, for example \code{external/deploy/assets/project\_name}.

It's necessary to use relative filepaths for images (normally this is by default). If this is not the case, execute the \code{File \textgreater{} External Data \textgreater{} Make All Paths Relative} operator. Using absolute filepaths instead of relative ones may lead to errors when loading \code{.blend} and \code{.json} files on other computers.

Upon export the scene is checked for Blender features not supported by the engine. In such cases an error message is generated:

{\hfill\includegraphics[width=1.000\linewidth]{error_message.jpg}\hfill}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] 
\end{DUlineblock}

The list of possible export errors is specified in the {\hyperref[addon:export-errors]{\emph{corresponding section}}}.


\subsection{Export Options}
\label{workflow:id4}\begin{description}
\item[{\emph{Autosave main file}}] \leavevmode
Autosaving the file from which export occurs. \textbf{Enabled by default}. Autosaving happens right after the export to guarantee conformity between the current blend-file and the exported file content. In addition, the relative path to the exported file is saved for convenience.

\item[{\emph{Filepath}}] \leavevmode
Path to the exported file. It is used in the command-line export mode and not used in windowed mode.

\end{description}

\index{viewer!scene adding}

\section{Displaying Scenes in the Viewer}
\label{workflow:id5}\label{workflow:index-1}
For the scene to appear in the viewer list it's required to manually add an entry to the text file \code{external/deploy/assets/assets.json}.

To add a new scene you need to know the category in which it should be displayed. The category normally corresponds to the project name and to the name of the directory where the corresponding files are stored.


\subsection{Example}
\label{workflow:id6}
For example below you can see a part of \code{assets.json}. In this file there are two projects - ``Capri'' and ``Fridge'' each with corresponding scenes:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYG{p}{\PYGZob{}}
    \PYG{n}{name}\PYG{p}{:} \PYG{l+s}{\PYGZdq{}}\PYG{l+s}{Capri}\PYG{l+s}{\PYGZdq{}}\PYG{p}{,}
    \PYG{n}{items}\PYG{p}{:} \PYG{p}{[}
        \PYG{p}{\PYGZob{}}
            \PYG{n}{name}\PYG{p}{:} \PYG{l+s}{\PYGZdq{}}\PYG{l+s}{Baken}\PYG{l+s}{\PYGZdq{}}\PYG{p}{,}
            \PYG{n}{load\PYGZus{}file} \PYG{p}{:} \PYG{l+s}{\PYGZdq{}}\PYG{l+s}{capri/props/baken/baken.json}\PYG{l+s}{\PYGZdq{}}
        \PYG{p}{\PYGZcb{}}\PYG{p}{,}
        \PYG{p}{\PYGZob{}}
            \PYG{n}{name}\PYG{p}{:} \PYG{l+s}{\PYGZdq{}}\PYG{l+s}{Terrain}\PYG{l+s}{\PYGZdq{}}\PYG{p}{,}
            \PYG{n}{load\PYGZus{}file} \PYG{p}{:} \PYG{l+s}{\PYGZdq{}}\PYG{l+s}{capri/landscape/terrain/terrain.json}\PYG{l+s}{\PYGZdq{}}
        \PYG{p}{\PYGZcb{}}
    \PYG{p}{]}
\PYG{p}{\PYGZcb{}}\PYG{p}{,}
\PYG{p}{\PYGZob{}}
    \PYG{n}{name}\PYG{p}{:} \PYG{l+s}{\PYGZdq{}}\PYG{l+s}{Fridge}\PYG{l+s}{\PYGZdq{}}\PYG{p}{,}
    \PYG{n}{items}\PYG{p}{:} \PYG{p}{[}
        \PYG{p}{\PYGZob{}}
            \PYG{n}{name}\PYG{p}{:} \PYG{l+s}{\PYGZdq{}}\PYG{l+s}{Apple}\PYG{l+s}{\PYGZdq{}}\PYG{p}{,}
            \PYG{n}{load\PYGZus{}file} \PYG{p}{:} \PYG{l+s}{\PYGZdq{}}\PYG{l+s}{fridge/fruits/apple/apple.json}\PYG{l+s}{\PYGZdq{}}
        \PYG{p}{\PYGZcb{}}\PYG{p}{,}
        \PYG{p}{\PYGZob{}}
            \PYG{n}{name}\PYG{p}{:} \PYG{l+s}{\PYGZdq{}}\PYG{l+s}{Mango}\PYG{l+s}{\PYGZdq{}}\PYG{p}{,}
            \PYG{n}{load\PYGZus{}file} \PYG{p}{:} \PYG{l+s}{\PYGZdq{}}\PYG{l+s}{fridge/fruits/mango/mango.json}\PYG{l+s}{\PYGZdq{}}
        \PYG{p}{\PYGZcb{}}
    \PYG{p}{]}
\PYG{p}{\PYGZcb{}}
\end{Verbatim}

To add a new scene you can copy and paste a similar scene's description to the required category and then edit its name and path to the exported file.

A successfully added scene should appear in the scenes' list of the viewer  in the required category.

{\hfill\includegraphics[width=1.000\linewidth]{viewer_apple_scene.jpg}\hfill}


\section{Application Development}
\label{workflow:id7}
At this stage an application is created. Logic for scene loading and user interaction is written using JavaScript. The application developer notes are given in the {\hyperref[developers:developers]{\emph{corresponding section}}}.

\section{Navigation}
\label{viewer:id2}
To control the camera hold down a mouse button and move the mouse. Also control can be performed using the \code{W}, \code{A}, \code{S}, \code{D}, \code{R}, \code{F} keys: forward, left, back, right, up, down. Arrows and \code{numpad} keys can be used as well. In the \code{Target} camera mode it's possible to focus on the selected object using the \code{Z} or \code{.(dot)} keys.


\section{The Side Panel}
\label{viewer:id3}
The side panel consists of three areas: the information board, basic control buttons and the list of drop-down panels with additional control elements differentiated by functionality.

\section{Static and Dynamic Objects}
\label{objects:id4}\label{objects:static-dynamic-objects}
All \code{MESH} objects can be divided into static and dynamic objects.

\textbf{Static objects} are objects, the meshes of which can be merged together if they have the same material.

\textbf{Dynamic objects} are objects, the meshes of which cannot be combined with each other.

Static objects are merged in order to optimize the number of draw calls. Dynamic objects are needed to make the movement of a separate object possible.

Among objects of the other type the dynamic ones are \code{CAMERA} and \code{ARMATURE}. All other objects are static.

The objects which have animation, physics or a parent, which is a dynamic object, are considered dynamic by default. When object movement is required but is not apparent from its settings, then its nesessary to enable the \emph{Blend4Web \textgreater{} Do not batch} checkbox.


\section{Camera}
\label{objects:id5}
The camera settings are specified in the \code{Properties} panel under the \code{Object Data} tab.

\emph{Blend4Web \textgreater{} Move style} -- camera control mode. By default the camera is in \code{Static} mode and this can be changed only through the API call. In the \code{Target} mode the camera is rotating around a fixed point. The \code{Eye} mode allows rotation and translation as in first person view.

\emph{Blend4Web \textgreater{} Target location} -- available in the \code{Target} mode. This is the position of the camera pivot point. The \code{Copy Cursor Location} button copies the current 3D cursor position into this value.

\emph{Blend4Web \textgreater{} DOF front distance} -- described in the {\hyperref[postprocessing_effects:postprocessing-effects]{\emph{Postprocessing Effects}}} section.

\emph{Blend4Web \textgreater{} DOF rear distance} -- described in the {\hyperref[postprocessing_effects:postprocessing-effects]{\emph{Postprocessing Effects}}} section.

\emph{Blend4Web \textgreater{} DOF power} -- described in the {\hyperref[postprocessing_effects:postprocessing-effects]{\emph{Postprocessing Effects}}} section.


\subsection{Limiting the camera movement}
\label{objects:id6}
There are several settings for the camera which limit its movement this way or another. They are grouped as \code{Camera limits}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering

\includegraphics{camera_limits.jpg}
\end{figure}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] 
\end{DUlineblock}

\textbf{Types of limits}

\emph{Blend4Web \textgreater{} Use distance limits} -- available in the \code{Target} mode. This defines the minimum and maximum distance from the camera to the pivot point.

Interval variants:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\emph{Max \textgreater{} Min} - the distance from the camera to the object is limited by the interval \emph{{[}Min, Max{]}}

\item {} 
\emph{Max = Min} - the camera is fixed on a certain height above the object

\item {} 
\emph{Max \textless{} Min} - no movement limits

\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering

\includegraphics{distance_limits.png}
\end{figure}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] 
\end{DUlineblock}

Default values: \emph{Min = 1, Max = 100}.

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] 
\end{DUlineblock}

\emph{Blend4Web \textgreater{} Use horizontal rotation clamping} -- available in the \code{Target} and \code{Eye} modes. Limits the camera's horizontal rotation relative to the pivot point (in the \code{Target} mode) or relative to its position (in the \code{Eye} mode).

The direction from \code{Left} to \code{Right} is considered positive and matches the counterclockwise direction for the \code{Target} mode, and the clockwise direction for the \code{Eye} mode:
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering

\includegraphics{horizontal_limits.png}
\end{figure}

Default values: \emph{Left = -180, Right = 180}.

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] 
\end{DUlineblock}

\emph{Blend4Web \textgreater{} Use vertical rotation clamping} -- available in the \code{Target} and \code{Eye} modes. Limits the camera's vertical rotation relative to the pivot point (in the \code{Target} mode) or relative to its position (in the \code{Eye} mode).

The direction from \code{Down} to \code{Up} is considered positive:
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering

\includegraphics{vertical_limits.png}
\end{figure}

If the \emph{Use horizontal rotation clamping} checkbox is enabled, vertical rotation will be limited at least to the interval \emph{{[}-90, 90{]}}.

Default values: \emph{Down = -90, Up = 90}.

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] 
\end{DUlineblock}

\textbf{Possible rotation limits pitfalls}
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
Swapping the \emph{Left/Right} or \emph{Down/Up} values swaps the rotations arcs.

\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering

\includegraphics{limits_inversion.png}
\end{figure}
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\emph{Left = Right, Up = Down} - fixes the camera horizontally and vertically (respectively).

\end{itemize}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] 
\end{DUlineblock}

\textbf{Rotation angles origin}

You can choose the space of coordinates for horizontal and vertical rotation limits:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\code{Camera space} - all angles are measured relative to the initial camera position and orientation.

\item {} 
\code{World space} - horizontal angles are measured starting from the Y axis in the world space, while vertical angles - relative to the horizontal plane XOY in the world space.

\end{itemize}

For horizontal limits:
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering

\includegraphics{camera_space_world_space_h.png}
\end{figure}

For vertical limits:
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering

\includegraphics{camera_space_world_space_v.png}
\end{figure}

The coordinate axes labelled on the pictures match the Blender's world coordinate axes.

By default the \code{Camera space} option is selected.

\item[{\emph{Dimensions}}] \leavevmode
Bitmap dimensions for image textures (image width and height in pixels) should be a 2$^{\text{N}}$ number, i.e. 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096 px. Using textures with other dimensions (so-called NPOT) is supported but is not recommended. Dimensions should be at least 4 pixels for the correct texture compression. Normally square images are used (e.g. 512 x 512 px), however rectangular ones can be used too (e.g. 4 x 128 px). Using images bigger than 2048 px is not recommended.

\item[{\emph{Image Mapping \textgreater{} Extension}}] \leavevmode
Texture coordinates interpretation mode (Wrap Mode in WebGL). This is available for \code{Image or Movie} texture type. In case of \code{Repeat} value the engine sets the \code{REPEAT} mode for the texture. In this case the integer part of the texture coordinates is ignored and the fractional part is used. In all other cases (for example \code{Extend}) the engine sets the \code{CLAMP\_TO\_EDGE} mode. In this case the texture coordinates are limited by the {[}0, 1{]} segment. The default value is \code{Repeat}.

\end{description}

\index{material capture}\index{matcap}\begin{description}
\item[{\emph{Mapping \textgreater{} Coordinates}}] \leavevmode
Texture coordinates type. Supported types are \code{UV} (use UV map), \code{Normal} (use direction at the camera; available only for diffuse maps; used for the creation of \textbf{material capture}, \textbf{matcap}). The default value is \code{Generated} (!).

\item[{\emph{Mapping \textgreater{} Offset}}] \leavevmode

The following types are supported: \code{Mix} (mixes with the color), \code{Multiply} (multiplies by the color). The default value is \code{Mix}.

\end{description}

\index{textures!specular map}\index{specular map}

\section{Specular Map}
\label{textures:index-5}\label{textures:specular-map}
The specular map is used for specifying the reflected light color distribution (the Phong model).


\subsection{Activation}
\label{textures:id6}
Enable the \code{Specular \textgreater{} Color} checkbox on the \code{Textures \textgreater{} Influence} panel (the \code{Specular \textgreater{} Intensity} checkbox is not supported).


\subsection{Additional settings}
\label{textures:id7}\begin{description}
\item[{\emph{Influence \textgreater{} Specular \textgreater{} Color}}] \leavevmode
The influence of the texture on the reflected light color. The default value is 1.0.

\item[{\emph{Influence \textgreater{} Blend}}] \leavevmode
The type of interaction with the reflected light color of the material (\code{Material \textgreater{} Specular \textgreater{} Color}). \code{Mix} (mixes with the color) is the only supported type. The default value is \code{Mix}.

\end{description}

The specular map can be packed to the alpha channel of a diffuse texture for optimization purposes. In such case it is required for the texture to enable the \code{Diffuse \textgreater{} Color} and \code{Specular \textgreater{} Color} checkboxes simultaneously. The color range is limited by gray tints.

\index{textures!normal map}\index{normal map}

\section{Normal Map}
\label{textures:index-6}\label{textures:normal-map}
A normal map is used for specifying the distribution of surface normals (perpendiculars) with the purpose of the relief detalization. The information about the normals should be stored in the texture space of coordinates. Normal maps baked in the object space of coordinates are not supported.

\section{Height Map. Parallax Mapping}
\label{textures:index-7}\label{textures:height-map-parallax-mapping}
A height map contains information about the distribution of relative relief heights. The higher the surface level is, the brighter is its color. A height map combined with a normal map is required for the implementation of relief surface effect (parallax mapping). A height map should be present in the alpha channel of a normal map.


\subsection{Activation}
\label{textures:id10}
For the normal map enable the \code{Parallax} checkbox on the \code{Textures \textgreater{} Blend4Web} panel in addition to the \code{Geometry \textgreater{} Normal} checkbox on the \code{Textures \textgreater{} Influence} panel.

\subsection{Additional settings}
\label{textures:id15}
In the case of generic materials one of the mixed diffuse textures can have the \code{Normal} (``matcap'') texture coordinates type.


\subsection{Limitations}
\label{textures:id16}
In case of generic materials the engine only interprets the red channel of a stencil map. Specular maps or normal maps (if any) are not being mixed. The \code{Mapping \textgreater{} Size} setting is extracted from the first texture and is applied to all remaining textures.


\subsection{Example}
\label{textures:id17}
The apple model material has the following textures: a normal map, a diffuse texture with a specular map in its alpha channel, a stencil map, a diffuse ``matcap'' map, an environment map.

\section{Environment Map}
\label{textures:environment-map}\label{textures:index-10}
An environment map is used as a mirror map and as a static sky texture (skydome).

The engine considers it as a cube texture. Environment map bitmaps should contain 6 projected environment images, packed in 2 rows 3 pieces in each (a Blender format). Bitmap dimensions for each image should follow the 2$^{\text{N}}$ rule (512, 1024 etc).

It is recommended to use the lossless format (PNG) in order to avoid seams.

{\hfill\includegraphics[width=1.000\linewidth]{environment_map.png}\hfill}


\subsection{Environment map creation}
\label{textures:id18}
Blender has an option for baking a scene into an environment map. To do this:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {} 
Create a scene for baking.

\item {} 
Add an empty object in the supposed point of view (\code{Add \textgreater{} Empty}).

\item {} 
Go to the \code{World} tab then to the \code{Textures} tab and create a new texture with the \code{Environment Map} type.

\item {} 
On the \code{Environment Map} panel select the \code{Static} source, then select the empty object in the \code{Viewport Object} field, then set the 2$^{\text{N}}$ dimension (512, 1024 etc).

\item {} 
Render the scene by pressing \code{F12} (a camera is required).

\item {} 
Save the environment map into a file.

\label{materials:id4}\label{materials:index-3}
Transparency implementation type can be selected in the \code{Alpha Blend} menu on the \code{Materials \textgreater{} Game Settings} panel (in the \code{Blender Game} mode).

The engine supports the following transparency implementation types (sorted in the ascending order by performance):
\begin{description}
\item[{\emph{Alpha Sort}}] \leavevmode
Transparent with a gradient. The engine sorts the triangles by camera distance in order to render overlapping transparent surfaces correctly. This operation is computationally expensive. It is recommended to use this feature for closed transparent geometry (bottle, car glass etc).

\item[{\emph{Alpha Blend}}] \leavevmode
Transparent with a gradient. The sorting of triangles is not performed. It is recommended to use this feature for unclosed transparent geometry (water surface, decals).

\item[{\emph{Add}}] \leavevmode
Transparent with a gradient. The sorting of triangles is not performed. The engine disables writing to the depth buffer which causes transparent surfaces to be rendered in arbitrary order. It is recommended to use this feature for effects (particle systems, glowing beams).

\item[{\emph{Alpha Clip}}] \leavevmode
Transparent without a gradient. The engine discards pixels if their alpha is less than 0.5. The sorting of triangles is not performed. It is recommended to use this feature with a mask texture to visualize smaller details (tree leaves, grass).

\item[{\emph{Opaque}}] \leavevmode
Non-transparent. Alpha is ignored. This is the default value.

\end{description}

{\hfill\includegraphics[width=1.000\linewidth]{alpha_types.jpg}\hfill}

\index{transparency!setup}

\subsection{Additional settings}
\label{materials:index-4}\label{materials:id5}\begin{description}
\item[{\emph{Transparency}}] \leavevmode
Enabling the transparency checkbox is required for viewing transparent objects in Blender. The engine ignores this option - the \code{Alpha Blend} option is used instead.

\item[{\emph{Transparency \textgreater{} Alpha}}] \leavevmode
Material transparency level. The engine ignores this parameter (in contrast to Blender) if there is a diffuse texture - the alpha channel values of a texture are used instead.

\item[{\emph{Options \textgreater{} Z Offset}, depth offset}] \leavevmode
This option explicitly specifies relative positioning order of objects with \textbf{different} materials with the purpose of depth sorting. The option can take both negative and positive values. The more distant the object is the lesser parameter value should be to provide correct rendering. The default value is 0.0.

\item[{\emph{Transparency \textgreater{} Fresnel}}] \leavevmode
Fresnel power for transparency. It is exported but is not used at the moment.

\item[{\emph{Transparency \textgreater{} Blend}}] \leavevmode

\subsection{Dynamic reflection}
\label{materials:index-7}\label{materials:id8}
A surface reflects the selected objects in their current position. Only reflection from a plane is supported.


\subsubsection{Activation}
\label{materials:id9}\begin{enumerate}
\item {} 
Enable the \code{Render reflections} checkbox on the \code{Scene \textgreater{} Blend4Web} panel.

\item {} 
Add an empty object as a reflection plane by executing for example \code{Add \textgreater{} Empty \textgreater{} Single Arrow}. Rename it for convenience.

{\hyperref[materials:fresnel]{\emph{Fresnel effect for reflection}}}



\index{reflection!Fresnel effect}\index{Fresnel effect}

\subsection{Fresnel effect for reflection}
\label{materials:id11}\label{materials:fresnel}\label{materials:index-8}
The Fresnel effect manifests itself as the dependency of the intencity of passing and reflected light on the incidence angle. If the angle of incidence is close to zero (i.e. light falls almost at right angle to the surface) the passing light portion is large and the reflected light portion is small. On the contrary if the angle of incidence is close to 90 degrees (i.e. light falls almost parallel to the surface) almost all light is reflected.

The engine uses the approximate Schlick's formula:
\begin{quote}

R = R$_{\text{0}}$ + (1 − R$_{\text{0}}$)(1 - cos \(\theta\))$^{\text{N}}$, where

R - reflection coefficient,

R$_{\text{0}}$ - reflection coefficient in case of viewing at a right angle to the surface (i.e. when \(\theta\) = 0),

\(\theta\) - angle of incidence (which is equal to the angle of reflection under which light enters the camera), it is calculated by the engine in real-time,

N - exponent.
\end{quote}


\subsubsection{Settings}
\label{materials:id12}
Fresnel effect can be set up both for static and dynamic reflection.
\begin{description}
\item[{\emph{Mirror \textgreater{} Fresnel}}] \leavevmode
Fresnel power for reflection. This is the N exponent in the Schlick's formula. In Blender it is limited to values from 0 to 5. If this parameter is equal to zero the Fresnel effect is not observed and the \emph{full} reflection at all angles occurs. If this parameter is greater than zero, the material is less reflective when viewing surfaces at angles which are close to the right angle. The bigger this parameter is the bigger is the angle deviation from the right angle for which the Fresnel effect is observed.

\item[{\emph{Mirror \textgreater{} Blend}}] \leavevmode
Fresnel factor for reflection. It is reduced to R$_{\text{0}}$ in the Schlick's formula by the following expression: R$_{\text{0}}$ = 1 - \code{Blend} / 5. In Blender it is limited to values from 0 to 5. This parameter defines the Fresnel effect intensity: the bigger the \code{Blend} factor is, the more is the Fresnel effect influence. If it is equal to zero the Fresnel effect is not observed.

\label{node_materials:id2}\label{node_materials:index-1}\label{node_materials:generic-node-materials}
\index{materials!nodes}
All Blender functions are supported except the following cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\code{Geometry} - the \code{Local}, \code{Orco} and \code{Vertex Alpha} outputs are not supported.

\item {} 
\code{Material}, \code{Extended Material} - no more than one node per material is allowed; the \code{Refl}, \code{Ambient}, \code{SpecTra}, \code{Ray Mirror} inputs are not supported; the \code{AO} output is not supported.

\item {} 
\code{RGB Curves} is not supported.

\item {} 
\code{Vector Curves} is not supported.

\end{itemize}

In addition a poor performance of some nodes in real-time context should be taken into account. It is not recommended to use the following nodes:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\code{Hue/Saturation}

\item {} 
\code{MixRGB} - the \code{Burn}, \code{Dodge}, \code{Value}, \code{Saturation}, \code{Hue}, \code{Color} types.

\end{itemize}

It is not recommended to create very complex materials especially if they use many \code{Geometry} or \code{Texture} nodes.


\section{Special Nodes}
\label{node_materials:custom-node-materials}\label{node_materials:id3}
\index{materials!nodes}
Special nodes extend the standard nodes' functionality in order to support the engine features. Special nodes are created as node groups (\code{Node groups} or \code{Node tree}) with specially determined names and input formats. All special nodes are gathered in the \code{special\_nodes.blend} file for convenience.


\subsection{LINEAR\_TO\_SRGB and SRGB\_TO\_LINEAR}
\label{node_materials:linear-to-srgb-srgb-to-linear}
Color correction from linear color space to sRGB space and back.


\strong{See also:}


{\hyperref[gamma_alpha:gamma-nodes]{\emph{Gamma Correction in Node Materials}}}




\subsection{REPLACE}
\label{node_materials:replace}
The node replaces the inputs depending on the working environment (i.e. Blender viewport or Blend4Web). When working in Blender the \code{Color1} input is connected to the \code{Color} output and the \code{Color2} input is ignored. On the contrary when working in the engine the inputs are interchanged (the \code{Color1} one is ignored and the \code{Color2} one is connected to the output). The node is intended to display one node structure in the viewport and another - in the engine.

As a rule it is used for normal mapping. Blender's node materials do not support a tangent space of coordinates. Therefore the only possible method to display normal maps in the viewport correctly is their usage inside the Material nodes.


\subsection{CLAMP}
\label{node_materials:clamp}
The node limits the output value. As a result all the output vector components take values from 0 to 1 inclusive.


\subsection{TIME}
\label{node_materials:time}
Provides the timeline counting from the engine start (in seconds). May be used for animating any parameters in the node materials.


\subsection{NORMAL\_VIEW}
\label{node_materials:normal-view}
The node transforms a normal into the camera's space of coordinates. Transformation is necessary because the engine defines all normals in the world space of coordinates. A normal should be used only for effects and not for connecting to the output of the \code{Material} or \code{Extended Material} nodes.


\subsection{PARALLAX}
\label{node_materials:parallax}
The node implements the texture coordinates offset using a height map.


\subsubsection{Input parameters}
\label{node_materials:id4}\begin{description}
\item[{\emph{UV}}] \leavevmode
Source texture coordinates

\item[{\emph{Height}}] \leavevmode
RGBA texture with a height map packed into the alpha channel.

\item[{\emph{Scale}}] \leavevmode
Texture coordinates offset factor

\item[{\emph{Steps}}] \leavevmode
The number of steps for iterative generation of texture coordinates offset. The bigger this value is the better is the final quality.

\end{description}


\subsubsection{Output parameters}
\label{node_materials:id5}\begin{description}
\item[{\emph{UV}}] \leavevmode
Resulting texture coordinates which are used as input for the texture nodes.

\end{description}


\subsection{TRANSLUCENCY}
\label{node_materials:translucency}
The node implements a translucency effect (with respect to light sources only) for thin objects such as cloth, leaves, paper etc. The effect consists of two parts: 1) brightening of the object side which is opposite to the light source and 2) appearance of a light spot right in the light source place.


\subsubsection{Input parameters}
\label{node_materials:id6}\begin{description}
\item[{\emph{Color}}] \leavevmode
One-channel texture which defines material heterogeneity - the white color denotes maximum translucency effect while the black color denotes its absence. White color is used by default.

\item[{\emph{Backside Factor}}] \leavevmode
Material color correction coefficient for the side which is opposite to the light source. It describes the color richness effect for the translucent areas.
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\emph{Backside Factor \textless{} 1} - brightening

\item {} 
\emph{Backside Factor = 1} - no correction

\item {} 
\emph{Backside Factor \textgreater{} 1} - darkening

\end{itemize}

The default value is 1.

\item[{\emph{Spot Hardness}}] \leavevmode
Light spot blurring factor. The bigger this value is the smaller is the spot and the sharper are the spot edges. The default value is 1000.

\item[{\emph{Spot Intensity}}] \leavevmode
Light spot intesity. The bigger this value is the brighter is the light spot. The default value is 1.

\item[{\emph{Spot Diffuse Factor}}] \leavevmode
Material diffuse color influence on the light spot color.
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\emph{Spot Diffuse Factor = 0} - the light spot has the diffuse color

\item {} 
\emph{Spot Diffuse Factor = 1} - the light spot color is white

\end{itemize}

The default value is 1.

\end{description}


\subsubsection{Output parameters}

For the \code{Surface} particle's materials it is \textbf{required} to have a diffuse texture (normally with an alpha-channel). In the \code{Mapping \textgreater{} Coordinates} menu choose the \code{UV} option.  Make sure that the emitter's mesh has a UV layer.

For the \code{Halo} particle's materials it is \textbf{possible} to use a \code{Blend} texture with a \code{Linear} gradient. In the \code{Mapping \textgreater{} Coordinates} menu choose the \code{Strand / Particle} option. It is required to enable \code{Ramp} on a texture. Up to 4 gradient control points are supported.

{\hfill\includegraphics[width=1.000\linewidth]{particles_settings_ramp_color.jpg}\hfill}


\subsection{Textures of particle systems}
\label{particles:id16}
Textures can also be used for setting up the behaviour of particle systems. Unlike textures for particle materials such textures belong to the particle system datablock, not to the material datablock. To create a texture for the particle system it is required to go \textbf{from} the \code{Particles} tab to the \code{Textures} tab and then to click the \code{New} button.

The only supported type of textures is \code{Blend} with a \code{Linear} gradient. \code{Ramp} should be enabled on the texture. Up to 4 gradient control points are supported.

On the \code{Influence} panel choose the parameter which is influenced by the texture. At the moment the only supported parameter is \code{Size}.

\section{Grass}
\label{particles_instancing:id3}\label{particles_instancing:particles-grass}
Instancing of objects can be used for visualizing vast grass. In this case grass is rendered near the camera when it moves through the landscape.

{\hfill\includegraphics[width=1.000\linewidth]{dynamic_grass.jpg}\hfill}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] 
\end{DUlineblock}

\textbf{Activation}
\begin{enumerate}
\item {} 
On a separate plane object create a particle system for object instancing. Enable the \code{Blend4Web \textgreater{} Dynamic Grass} option.

\item {} 
On the supposed landscape material enable the \code{Blend4Web \textgreater{} Terrain dynamic grass} option.

\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Setup}

It is recommended to create a few planes (for example 3) with sizes corresponding to the desired grass cascades (e.g. 100, 150 and 250 meters).

On the landscape \textbf{material} the following text fields get active when the \code{Blend4Web \textgreater{} Terrain dynamic grass} option is enabled:
\begin{description}
\item[{\emph{Dynamic grass size (R)}}] \leavevmode
Vertex color layer name of the landscape mesh which is intended for modifying the grass size. The size (i.e. height) of the grass is defined by gray tints - the brighter color the is the higher is the grass.

\item[{\emph{Dynamic grass color (RGB)}}] \leavevmode
Name of the landscape mesh's vertex color layer which is intended for grass tinting. The vertex color is multiplied by the grass material color. The \code{Influence \textgreater{} Blend} parameter for the grass material's diffuse texture should have the \code{Multiply} value.

\end{description}

Vertex color layers with such names should exist in the landscape mesh.

It is also recommended to disable rendering of the emitter (the \code{Render \textgreater{} Emitter} option).

{\hfill\includegraphics[width=1.000\linewidth]{dynamic_grass_setup.jpg}\hfill}


\section{Tree Leaves}
\label{particles_instancing:particles-leaves}\label{particles_instancing:id4}
Instancing suits the rendering of tree leaves well and allows to get a better level of detail.

{\hfill\includegraphics[width=1.000\linewidth]{tree_leaves.jpg}\hfill}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] 
\end{DUlineblock}

\textbf{Activation}

Performed as described in the \code{Particle system setup -\textgreater{} Activation} section (see above). In this case the tree is the emitter and the leaves and the small branches are the particles.

Additionally the following operations should be performed for the emitter:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
create a vertex group which includes vertices on which the particles will be placed

\item {} 
create a vertex color layer for the wind bending parameters of the tree and the leaves

\item {} 
create a vertex color layer to be inherited by the particles (for example it can be used for tinting the particles)

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Setup}
\begin{enumerate}
\item {} 
\code{Random rotation settings}

\end{enumerate}

If the \code{Blend4Web \textgreater{} Initial random rotation} checkbox is enabled then it is recommended to select the vertical axis for random rotation - \code{Z axis} (the \code{Blend4Web \textgreater{} Rotation type} menu). The \code{Blend4Web \textgreater{} Rotation strength} value can be set too.
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item {} 
\code{Billboarding settings}

\end{enumerate}

It is recommended to enable billboarding, to set its type as \code{Jittered} (the \code{Blend4Web \textgreater{} Billboard type} menu) and to make it spherical - \code{Spherical} (the \code{Blend4Web \textgreater{} Billboard geometry} menu). The \code{Blend4Web \textgreater{} Jitter amplitude} and \code{Blend4Web \textgreater{} Jitter frequency} values can be set too.
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item {} 
\code{Particles location settings}

\end{enumerate}

It is recommended to select the \code{Verts} value from the \code{Emission \textgreater{} Emit From} menu, and to select in the \code{Vertex Group \textgreater{} Density} field the emitter's vertex group which defines the placing of particles. Also the \code{Blend4Web \textgreater{} Random location and size} checkbox shoud be disabled.
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\item {} 
\code{Wind Bending settings}

\end{enumerate}

It is recommended to enable inheritance settings from the emitter - select the \code{Parent} in the \code{Blend4Web \textgreater{} Wind bending} menu. Then for the emitter on the \code{Object} panel enable the \code{Blend4Web \textgreater{} Wind bending} checkbox and setup the bending parameters. For a tree it is enough to specify the \code{Blend4Web \textgreater{} Main Bending \textgreater{} Angle} and \code{Blend4Web \textgreater{} Main Bending \textgreater{} Frequency} parameters and also a vertex color name for bending in the \code{Blend4Web \textgreater{} Main Bending \textgreater{} Main stiffness} field.
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{4}
\item {} 
\code{Vertex color inheritance settings}

\end{enumerate}

For the emitter's vertex color to be inherited it is required to specify the emitter's vertex color name and the particle's vertex color name respectively in the \code{Blend4Web \textgreater{} Vertex Color \textgreater{} from} and \code{Blend4Web \textgreater{} Vertex Color \textgreater{} to} fields. The color of the emitter's vertex that is closest to the particle and specified in the \code{from} field will be copied and propagated into the \code{to} particle's vertex color layer, as a result.

The resulting vertex color layer with the \code{Blend4Web \textgreater{} Vertex Color \textgreater{} to} name may be used in the particle's node material for its tinting or other effects.

\phantomsection\label{animation:animation}
\index{animation}\index{animation}

\chapter{Animation}
\label{animation:index-0}\label{animation::doc}\label{animation:id1}
In general animation is changing the object's parameters in time. The engine supports the following types of animation:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
Object animation is the moving an object as a whole. The parameters that can be animated are the center coordinates (\code{Location}), the rotation's quaternion (\code{Rotation} in the \code{Quaternion(WXYZ)} mode) and scaling (\code{Scale}).

\item {} 
Skeletal animation, i.e. object deformation using bones. Animation of a standalone armature object is also supported (for parenting to bones).

\item {} 
Vertex animation. An object's deformations can be recorded as frames and then reproduced in the engine.

\item {} 
Audio sources parametrization. Speaker's \code{Volume} and \code{Pitch} can be animated.

\item {} 
Wind bending - a procedural animation. Described {\hyperref[outdoor_rendering:wind]{\emph{separately}}}.

\item {} 
Particle emission. Described in the {\hyperref[particles:particles]{\emph{corresponding section}}}.

\end{itemize}


\section{Animation Control}
\label{animation:id2}
There are two ways to control animation in the engine:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {} 
Automatically, using the \code{Animation: Use default} and \code{Animation: Cyclic} checkboxes in the object's properties. In this case an appropriate animation method will be chosen by the engine and the object's animation playback will start just after a scene is loaded. In case of skeletal animation the action which is assigned to the object in the \code{Action Editor} window is played by default.

\item {} 
In an application via API using the \code{animation} module methods.

\end{enumerate}

It's useful to use the \code{Animation} interface for tweaking animation. This is covered in the {\hyperref[viewer:viewer]{\emph{corresponding section}}}.


\section{Object Animation}
\label{animation:id3}
Animation keyframes can be added for an object motion in Blender and then reproduced in the engine.

The following keyframe types are supported:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\emph{Location}

\item {} 
\emph{Rotation} -- the \code{Quaternion(WXYZ)} mode is required.

\item {} 
\emph{Scale} -- for correct results the scale factor should be the same along all 3 axes.

\item {} 
\emph{LocRot} -- a combination of \emph{Location} and \emph{Rotation}.

\item {} 
\emph{LocScale} -- a combination of \emph{Location} and \emph{Scale}.

\item {} 
\emph{LocRotScale} -- a combination of \emph{Location}, \emph{Rotation} and \emph{Scale}.

\item {} 
\emph{RotScale} -- a combination of \emph{Rotation} and \emph{Scale}.

\end{itemize}

If an object-mesh is animated it is required to enable the \code{Do not batch} checkbox under the object properties tab.


\section{Skinning and Skeletal Animation}
\label{animation:id4}
For skeletal animation both a mesh object and an armature object are needed. The four steps should be carried out:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {} 
Create the object's ``skeleton'' in the armature object.

\item {} 
Assign vertex groups in the mesh object and link them to the bones. This can be performed by weight painting for example.

\item {} 
Animate the bones in the pose mode of the armature object. The same keyframe types can be used as for the object animation.

\item {} 
When inverse kinematics (IK) or other nontrivial structures are used, an additional step is required to bake the animations (\code{Action} datablocks in Blender). Baking can be performed using the \code{B4W Animation Bake} interface located on the \code{Blend4Web} panel.

\end{enumerate}

{\hfill\includegraphics[width=1.000\linewidth]{baker.png}\hfill}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] 
\end{DUlineblock}

Baking is performed with the armature object selected. Elements of the \code{B4W Animation Bake} interface:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\emph{Clean keyframes} -- optimize the animation keyframes after baking. In case of incorrect results it's recommended to turn this option off.

\item {} 
window with the list of actions being baked -- bake only the actions which are listed, else - bake all the actions possible.

\item {} 
\emph{Name} -- the current action name from the list of actions being baked.

\item {} 
\emph{Bake} -- perform baking. If the process is completed successfully, actions with names of \emph{NAME\_B4W\_BAKED} type appear in the scene. These actions can be assigned to the armature object and played back in the engine. It's worth noting that appropriate functioning of such actions in Blender is not garanteed, although the \emph{Cons Mute}/\emph{Cons Unmute} interface can help in some cases.

\item {} 
\emph{Cons Mute}/\emph{Cons Unmute} -- switch bone constraints off/on. The tool can be used for testing the baked actions.

\end{itemize}


\section{Vertex Animation}
\label{animation:id5}
Allows to record any geometry changes of a mesh object. Note that every vertex animation frame counts as a mesh. It's not recommended to make a long animation for a high-poly mesh, as it can increase the size of the source and exported files significantly and can also slow down the work of the engine.

A special tool is used for baking vertex animation - \code{B4W Vertex Anim Baker} - located on the \code{Blend4Web} tools panel.

{\hfill\includegraphics[width=1.000\linewidth]{vertex_anim_baker.jpg}\hfill}


\section{Audio Source Parametrization}
\label{animation:id6}
In addition the following animation key types are supported for the speaker objects:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\emph{Volume}

\item {} 
\emph{Pitch}

\end{itemize}

Audio sources parametering in essence follows object animation.

\subsubsection{Creating a texture with shoreline parameters.}
\label{outdoor_rendering:index-0}\label{outdoor_rendering:id24}\label{outdoor_rendering:shore-distance-bake}
On the tools panel (hotkey ``T'') under the \code{Blend4Web} tab open the \code{B4W Shore Distance Baker} panel. Set the parameters: maximum distance to shore (\code{Maximum Distance}) and the resulting texture size (\code{Texture Size}). Select a landscape object (or multiple objects) first, and then - a water object. Click the \code{Bake Shore Distance} button.

Depending on the texture size and the number of vertices in the processed meshes the execution time of the script may vary from a fraction of a second up to several minutes. Make sure that the texture named \code{ShoreDistance} is created for the water mesh.

Upon script execution some system properties are saved in the water material. Therefore the scene must be saved after the script has finished working.

\chapter{Gamma Correction and Alpha Compositing}
\label{gamma_alpha::doc}\label{gamma_alpha:gamma}\label{gamma_alpha:id1}

\section{Overview}
\label{gamma_alpha:id2}
The essence of gamma correction is packing the image brightness channel into 8 bits of information.

Graphics editors normally work in a non-linear color space where the darker components are encoded using more bits than the brighter ones. That means that a bigger RGB value corresponds to 0.5 of the real light intensity (a physical quantity called illuminance) - in a simplest case this value equals to 0.5 \textasciicircum{} (1/2.2) = 0.73.

{\hfill\includegraphics[width=1.000\linewidth]{gamma.jpg}\hfill}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] 
\end{DUlineblock}

Images are always stored in a non-linear space because if they were not, 8 bits of information would not be enough to encode the light intensity and it would result in a wrong rendering of the darker tints.

Web browsers work in a non-linear space.

When the \code{Color Management \textgreater{} Display Device \textgreater{} sRGB} option is enabled for a scene, Blender works in a linear space. Material colors and lamp settings correspond to physical values. For texture images (except normal maps) it is required to select the \code{Image \textgreater{} Input Color Space \textgreater{} sRGB} option. In this case an automatic image unpacking (sRGB -\textgreater{} Linear) is performed at the time of rendering.

Engines and renderers work in a linear space because this is the only correct way to represent light behavior in the real world. For example, the illuminance from two identical lamps exceeds the illuminance from one lamp exactly by two times.

Some values of illuminance:

\begin{tabulary}{\linewidth}{|L|L|}
\hline
\textsf{\relax 
Description
} & \textsf{\relax 
Illuminance, lux

\hline

 & 
100
\\

Full moon by night
 & 
0.2
\\

Moonless light
 & 
0.001
\\
\hline\end{tabulary}



\section{Human Vision, Monitors and Gamma Correction}
\label{gamma_alpha:id3}
While the human vision is non-linear (a human recognizes the darker light tints better than the brighter ones), the light coming into the eye still obeys the physical laws (see the lamps example).

In CRT monitors the brightness is dependent non-linearly upon the electric voltage applied to the monitor's input (the voltage itself is determined by the color channel value in the video memory). LCD monitors mimic the same characteristics. Nevertheless the light emitted by such monitors obeys the physical laws. For example the addition of a second light source to a virtual scene should cause the brightness to double (in the perfect case).

Therefore the perception characteristics of the human eye and the technical characteristics of monitors have a secondary significance for gamma correction.


\section{Gamma}
\label{gamma_alpha:id4}
Used in the following simplified formula:
\begin{quote}

V$_{\text{out}}$ = V$_{\text{in}}$$^{\text{\(\gamma\)}}$
\end{quote}

\(\gamma\) \textless{} 1 - packing gamma, \(\gamma\) \textgreater{} 1 - unpacking gamma. In the simplest case 1/2.2 and 2.2 values are used respectively. Hereinafter the ``packing'' (Linear -\textgreater{} sRGB) and ``unpacking'' (sRGB -\textgreater{} Linear) terms are used instead of ``gamma correction''.


\section{Gamma Correction in Node Materials}
\label{gamma_alpha:gamma-nodes}\label{gamma_alpha:id5}

\subsection{Nodes for colouring}
\label{gamma_alpha:id6}
Unpacking (sRGB -\textgreater{} Linear) is required when textures and vertex colors are used for colouring (not for masking). The texture node implements unpacking automatically. For vertex colors the unpacking should be performed explicitely with the \emph{SRGB\_TO\_LINEAR} special node.

Note that the alpha channel of a texture node is not corrected. Its values are in the linear space.


\subsection{Nodes for masking}
\label{gamma_alpha:id7}
Textures and vertex colors can be used as masks i.e. for mixing colors and for other mathematical operations. In such a case no transformations are required.

In case of a texture however there is a nuance: a texture node implements unpacking automatically. This results in necessity of the additional transformation back to the non-linear space, for which the \emph{LINEAR\_TO\_SRGB} node is used.


\subsection{Normal maps}
\label{gamma_alpha:id8}
No transformations are performed for normal maps.


\subsection{Resulting table of correction in node materials}
\label{gamma_alpha:id9}
\begin{tabulary}{\linewidth}{|L|L|}

\section{Alpha Compositing}
\label{gamma_alpha:id10}

\subsection{Overview}
\label{gamma_alpha:id11}
Physically correct alpha compositing is performed according to the formula {[}\href{http://wwwnew.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring05/cos426/papers/smith95a.pdf}{source}{]}:
\begin{quote}

\(C_o = C_a \alpha_a + C_b \alpha_b (1 - \alpha_a)\).
\end{quote}

This formula differs from the classic mix operation (aka convex combination) because it has the \(\alpha_b\) multiplier in the second summand. Therefore not only the \(\alpha_a\) value of the source pixel should be known for alpha compositing, but also the \(\alpha_b\) value of the pixel over which the rendering is performed.

In case of preliminary multiplication of the \(\alpha\) values by the color channels (so called premultiplied alpha) the formula becomes as following:
\begin{quote}

\(C_o = C_a + C_b (1 - \alpha_a)\).
\end{quote}

The last formula is used also to calculate the resulting \(\alpha_o\) value:
\begin{quote}

\(\alpha_o = \alpha_a + \alpha_b (1 - \alpha_a)\).
\end{quote}

Preliminary multiplication of the color channels by the \(\alpha\) values allows to save two multiplication operations. The more significant thing is that the derived formula can be used repeatedly without the need to divide the \(C_o\) color by the \(\alpha_o\) value on each consequent iteration.


\subsection{Implementation}
\label{gamma_alpha:id13}
The blending function used in Blend4Web is the following:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
gl.blendFunc(gl.ONE, gl.ONE\PYGZus{}MINUS\PYGZus{}SRC\PYGZus{}ALPHA);
\end{Verbatim}

WebGL context initialization is performed using the \emph{premultipliedAlpha = true} parameter (that is the default value). Also multiplication of all the color channels by the \(\alpha\) value is performed on the output of the shaders.


\chapter{Audio System}
\label{audio:audio}\label{audio::doc}\label{audio:id1}
Audio sources are created in Blender. The standard \code{Speaker} object is used.

{\hfill\includegraphics[width=1.000\linewidth]{speaker.jpg}\hfill}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] 
\end{DUlineblock}


\section{Audio Source Settings}
\label{audio:id2}
Speaker parameters can be set up on the \code{Properties} panel under the \code{Object Data} tab.

The engine supports all the standard parameters. The engine-specific settings are located on the \code{Blend4Web} panel.
\begin{description}
\item[{\emph{Speaker behavior}}] \leavevmode
The behavior of the audio source.

\code{Positional} --- high-quality sound with spatial positioning and directivity (conicity). The Web Audio API is used for sound rendering. Playback performance of such sounds is the least and so use them only for short samples.

\code{Background sound} --- high-quality omnidirectional sound without spatial positioning. The Web Audio API is used for sound rendering. It is more performant but is not effective for music.

\code{Background music} --- used for music playback. It has maximum performance due to the use of the Audio HTML tag, but has minimum flexibility.

\item[{\emph{Disable doppler}}] \leavevmode
Ignore source's frequency shift upon its moving.

\item[{\emph{Cyclic play}}] \leavevmode
Loop the sound playback.

\item[{\emph{Delay}}] \leavevmode
Delay before sound playback starts.

\item[{\emph{Random delay}}] \leavevmode
Additional delay randomization. The resulting value is calculated according to the formula \(Delay_{result} = Delay + Delay_{random} * Random_{[0-1]}\).

\item[{\emph{Random volume}}] \leavevmode
Additional volume randomization. The resulting value is calculated as for the delay.

\item[{\emph{Random pitch}}] \leavevmode
Additional randomization of the sound playback speed. The resulting value is calculated as for the delay.

\item[{\emph{Fade-in}}] \leavevmode
Fade-in time interval.

\item[{\emph{Fade-out}}] \leavevmode
Fade-out time interval.

\item[{\emph{Loop}}] \leavevmode
Loop the sound playback. Contrary to the \code{Cyclic play} option it guarantees a zero delay upon repeat. The option is available only for sound sources with \code{Positional} or \code{Background sound} behavior.

\item[{\emph{Loop count}}] \leavevmode
Not implemented.

\item[{\emph{Random loop count}}] \leavevmode

\section{Processing and Decoding}
\label{audio:id3}\label{audio:encoding}

\subsection{Supported formats (containers):}
\label{audio:id4}\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
ogg, Vorbis codec (Chrome, Firefox)

\item {} 
mp3 (Chrome, Safari)

\item {} 
mp4, AAC codec (Chrome, Safari)

\end{itemize}

It is recommended to use \textbf{ogg} as it is an open standard, is widespread in browsers and provides good sound quality. The optimal format in respect to the quality and compatibility is 48kHz/16bit. Single-channel sound (mono) is used to store shot samples while two-channel sound (stereo) is used for music playback.

To support a wider range of platforms, a Python script (scripts/converter.py) for converting the source files into other formats is included into the distribution. Run it with the command:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZgt{} ./converter.py convert\PYGZus{}sounds
\end{Verbatim}

Converting is performed according to the scheme:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
ogg -\textgreater{} mp4

\item {} 
mp3 -\textgreater{} ogg

\item {} 
mp4 -\textgreater{} ogg

\end{itemize}

Resource converting is performed with quality loss and so the resulting files receive a .lossconv suffix.


\chapter{Physics}
\label{physics:physics}\label{physics::doc}\label{physics:id1}

\section{Preparing for Use}
\label{physics:id2}
The physics system is implemented in the \textbf{uranium.js} module and loaded separately from the engine's main code. The \textbf{uranium.js} module itself is a modification of the \href{http://bulletphysics.org/}{Bullet} physics engine, which is ported to work in browsers. To enable the physics system and to specify the \textbf{uranium.js} module's loading path, applications must use the external API:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYG{n+nx}{b4w}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n+nx}{config}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n+nx}{set}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{l+s+s2}{\PYGZdq{}physics\PYGZus{}enabled\PYGZdq{}}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{k+kc}{true}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}
\PYG{n+nx}{b4w}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n+nx}{config}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n+nx}{set}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{l+s+s2}{\PYGZdq{}physics\PYGZus{}uranium\PYGZus{}path\PYGZdq{}}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{l+s+s2}{\PYGZdq{}../../external/deploy/apps/common/uranium.js\PYGZdq{}}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}
\end{Verbatim}

To enable physics on the scene use the \code{Enable physics} checkbox under the scene tab in Blender.

\includegraphics[width=1.000\linewidth]{scene.jpg}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[]

\section{Static Physics Type}
\label{physics:id3}
Can be used to limit the movement of other objects, for example to detect collisions with a landscape, walls and so on. In the physics settings of such an object the \code{Static} value (set by default) should be selected for the \code{Physics Type} option.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering

\includegraphics[width=0.800\linewidth]{physics_panel_static.jpg}
\end{figure}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] 
\end{DUlineblock}

One or multiple physics materials can be assigned to a mesh. Under the \code{Material} tab the \code{Special: Collision} checkbox must be enabled. The material physics settings are also located on the \code{Physics} panel under the \code{Material} tab (in the \code{Blender Game} mode). The following material physics settings are supported: \code{Friction}, \code{Elasticity}.

\includegraphics[width=1.000\linewidth]{material_panel_physics.jpg}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] 
\end{DUlineblock}

The \code{Collision ID} field is intended for detecting collisions with specific materials and can be left empty. An example of \code{Collision ID} usage is detecting the landscape surface a character is located on - grass, sand, wooden coating and so on.

The \code{Ghost} option excludes the material from physical interactions but still notifies the application about the contact with it. An example - detecting that the character is located on a vertical ladder.

\includegraphics[width=1.000\linewidth]{physics_water_tower.jpg}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] 
\end{DUlineblock}

The \code{Collision group} field corresponds to the physics group which the material belongs to. The \code{Collision mask} field defines all physics groups with which this material will interact.


\section{Dynamic Physics Type}
\label{physics:id4}
Intended for rigid body movement simulation.

\includegraphics[width=1.000\linewidth]{physics_dynamic.jpg}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] 
\end{DUlineblock}

In the physics settings of such an object the \code{Rigid Body} (with rotations) or \code{Dynamic} (without rotations) values can be selected for the \code{Physics Type} option. In the \code{Collision Bounds} settings the collider type can be selected - the supported types are: \code{Box}, \code{Capsule}, \code{Sphere}, \code{Cylinder}, \code{Cone}. Other supported settings are: \code{Mass}, \code{Damping} - for \code{Translation} and \code{Rotation}.

The \code{Collision group} field corresponds to the physics group which the object belongs to.

The \code{Collision mask} field defines all physics groups with which this object will interact.
\begin{figure}[htbp]

\end{figure}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] 
\end{DUlineblock}

The \code{Detect collisions} checkbox must be enabled under the object's physics tab. The \code{Collision ID} field is intended for detecting collisions with a specific object (for example for detecting proximity of a FPS character to different items) and can be left empty.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering

\includegraphics[width=0.800\linewidth]{object.jpg}
\end{figure}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] 
\end{DUlineblock}

\code{Friction} and \code{Elasticity} are supported for the material of such an object. When multiple materials are used on a single mesh, the physics parameters are taken from the first of them.

For the camera object the \code{Physics Type} = \code{Dynamic} parameter must be used, and the \code{Detect collisions} checkbox must be enabled.


\section{Constraints}
\label{physics:constraints}
Physical constraints are used for limiting the objects' degrees of freedom.

\includegraphics[width=1.000\linewidth]{physics_constraints.jpg}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] 
\end{DUlineblock}

Adding a physical constraint (\code{Rigid Body Joint}) to the object can be performed on the \code{Object Constraints} panel. The supported types (\code{Pivot Type}) are: \code{Ball}, \code{Hinge}, \code{Cone Twist}, \code{Generic 6 DoF}. A physical constraint can be added to one of the two interacting objects, while the other object acts as a \code{Target}. Both objects can have a static and/or dynamic physics type. In constraints (except \code{Ball}) the translation and rotation limits can be set up.

\includegraphics[width=1.000\linewidth]{physics_constraints_panel.jpg}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] 
\end{DUlineblock}


\section{Wheeled Vehicles}
\label{physics:id5}
The model of a vehicle must consist of 6 separate objects - a chassis, 4 wheels and a steering wheel. The chassis' mesh center should correspond to the mass center. The centers of the wheels' and the steering wheel's meshes should be located on the rotation axes. The steering wheel should be oriented in the local space of coordinates - X - the rotation axis, Y - to the right and Z - upwards. The object can have any names.

\includegraphics[width=1.000\linewidth]{physics_vehicle_wheeled.jpg}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] 
\end{DUlineblock}

For all 6 objects: select the \code{Vehicle part}, specify the same id in the \code{Vehicle name} field, select the right object type - \code{Chassis}, \code{Steering wheel}, \code{Back right wheel} and so on. A \code{Suspension rest length} setting is also available for the wheels.

It is neccessary to specify a realistic mass for the chassis (because the default value is only 1 kg). To do this go to the physics settings, choose the \code{Rigid Body} value for the \code{Physics Type} option and specify the required value (for example, 1000 kg) in the \code{Mass} field.


\subsection{Chassis settings parameters}
\label{physics:id6}\begin{description}
\item[{\emph{Vehicle Settings \textgreater{} Force max}}] \leavevmode
Maximum driving force of the vehicle

\item[{\emph{Vehicle Settings \textgreater{} Brake max}}] \leavevmode
Maximum braking coefficient

\item[{\emph{Vehicle Settings \textgreater{} Suspension compression}}] \leavevmode
Damping coefficient for suspension stretching

\item[{\emph{Vehicle Settings \textgreater{} Suspension stiffness}}] \leavevmode
Suspension stiffness coefficient

\item[{\emph{Vehicle Settings \textgreater{} Suspension damping}}] \leavevmode
Suspension damping coefficient

\item[{\emph{Vehicle Settings \textgreater{} Wheel friction}}] \leavevmode
Friction constant between the wheels and the surface. It should be around 0.8 for realistic vehicles. But it can be increased significantly to achieve a better control (1000 and more).

\item[{\emph{Vehicle Settings \textgreater{} Roll influence}}] \leavevmode
Decreases the wheels' torque decreasing the probability of the vehicle overturning (0 - no torque, 1 - real physics behavior).

\item[{\emph{Vehicle Settings \textgreater{} Max suspension travel cm}}] \leavevmode
Maximum suspension travel in centimeters.

\end{description}

For the \code{Steering wheel} it is necessary to specify the maximum steering angle (\code{Steering max}) and the ratio between the turn of the steering wheel and the turn of the wheels  (\code{Steering ratio}). The maximum steering angle value is specified in revolutions. A single revolution equals to 360 degrees. Therefore if \code{Steering max} is equal to one and \code{Steering ratio} is equal to 10, the maximum turn of the steering wheel will be 360 degrees and the maximum turn of the front wheels will be 36 degrees.

On this stage you can export and load the scene into the engine. We recommend to create a road surface with a physics material. To choose the controlled object press the \code{Q} key in the Viewer and select the chassis. Use the \code{W}, \code{A}, \code{S}, \code{D} keys as controls.

We can additionally tweak the \code{Damping} of \code{Translation} and \code{Rotation}. This will influence the speed and inertion of the vehicle.

The friction and elasticity of the road surface material do not influence the vehicle's behavior.


\section{Floating Objects}
\label{physics:id7}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[]

In order for the object to float on the water surface (an object with the \code{Special water} material), it is neccessary to enable the \code{Floating} checkbox. There are two types of floating objects: \code{Main body} - the floating object itself and \code{Bob} - an auxiallary bob-object onto which the buoyancy will be acting. A floating object can have an unlimited number of \code{Bob} objects. This can be both meshes or \code{Empty} objects.

All objects that are part of the same floating object must have the same name in the \code{Floater name} field.

Watercrafts use some parameters from the \code{Vehicle settings} and all the settings which are similar to \code{Floating settings}. It is neccessary to set the \code{Vehicle part} type \code{Hull} on the main object. Similar to a floating object a watercraft requires auxillary \code{Bob} objects.

\chapter{Non-Linear Animation}
\label{nla:nla}\label{nla::doc}\label{nla:id1}
The Blender's non-linear editor lets us set the scene's behavior in a comfortable way. With its help we can implement a simple scenario which does not require any interference from the user. This way coding is not needed for simple scenes and demo applications.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering

\includegraphics{nla_editor.jpg}
\end{figure}

The engine supports controlling the following entities:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
Any animation the parameters of which can be presented with Actions

\item {} 
Audio playback

\item {} 
Particles emission (in the form of a connection with the global timeline)

\end{itemize}


\section{Activation}
\label{nla:id2}\begin{enumerate}
\item {} 
Enable the \code{Use NLA} checkbox under the \code{Scene} tab.

\item {} 
In the \code{NLA Editor} set up the required behavior for the scene.

\item {} 
Choose the animation time interval on the \code{Timeline} panel.

\end{enumerate}


\section{Additional Options}
\label{nla:id3}
The \emph{Blend4Web \textgreater{} Cyclic NLA} scene setting activates the cyclic NLA animation mode.


\section{Limitations}
\label{nla:id4}\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
Vertex animation is not supported.

\item {} 
Scaling and looping of separate animation strips is not supported.

\item {} 
A simultanious playback of differnet types of animation for the same object is not supported.

\end{itemize}

\section{A Hello World! App}
\label{developers:hello-world}
The simplest Blend4Web app may look like this:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]

\end{Verbatim}

The engine library is embedded with the \code{\textless{}script src="..."\textgreater{}} tag. The app waits for the page to load and prints the current version in the browser window.


\section{Loading a Scene into an App}
\label{developers:id2}
To load a 3D scene you need:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {} 
Place a \code{\textless{}canvas\textgreater{}} element on a page for rendering.

\item {} 
Call the \code{m\_main.init()} function with the created element id to init the WebGL context after the page is loaded.

\item {} 
Call the \code{m\_data.load()} function to load a 3D scene.

\end{enumerate}

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]

\end{Verbatim}

Note that a real app should include error checking, setting up the engine before initializing and also a basic system for interacting with the user.


\section{Creating Apps Quickly}
\label{developers:id3}
Creating an app from scratch can be a tedious task, especially for beginners. To address this there is a special addon for the engine called \code{app.js}. The addon can be linked up similar to the main \code{b4w.min.js} module and can be accessed via the \code{app} namespace:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYG{c+cp}{\PYGZlt{}!DOCTYPE html\PYGZgt{}}
\PYG{n+nt}{\PYGZlt{}html}\PYG{n+nt}{\PYGZgt{}}
\PYG{n+nt}{\PYGZlt{}head}\PYG{n+nt}{\PYGZgt{}}
\PYG{n+nt}{\PYGZlt{}script }\PYG{n+na}{src=}\PYG{l+s}{\PYGZdq{}b4w.min.js\PYGZdq{}}\PYG{n+nt}{\PYGZgt{}}\PYG{n+nt}{\PYGZlt{}/script\PYGZgt{}}
\PYG{n+nt}{\PYGZlt{}script }\PYG{n+na}{src=}\PYG{l+s}{\PYGZdq{}app.js\PYGZdq{}}\PYG{n+nt}{\PYGZgt{}}\PYG{n+nt}{\PYGZlt{}/script\PYGZgt{}}
\PYG{n+nt}{\PYGZlt{}script}\PYG{n+nt}{\PYGZgt{}}

\PYG{k+kd}{var} \PYG{n+nx}{m\PYGZus{}app} \PYG{o}{=} \PYG{n+nx}{b4w}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n+nx}{require}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{l+s+s2}{\PYGZdq{}app\PYGZdq{}}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}
\PYG{k+kd}{var} \PYG{n+nx}{m\PYGZus{}data} \PYG{o}{=} \PYG{n+nx}{b4w}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n+nx}{require}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{l+s+s2}{\PYGZdq{}data\PYGZdq{}}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}

\PYG{n+nx}{m\PYGZus{}app}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n+nx}{init}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{p}{\PYGZob{}}
    \PYG{n+nx}{canvas\PYGZus{}container\PYGZus{}id}\PYG{o}{:} \PYG{l+s+s2}{\PYGZdq{}body\PYGZus{}id\PYGZdq{}}\PYG{p}{,}
    \PYG{n+nx}{callback}\PYG{o}{:} \PYG{n+nx}{load\PYGZus{}cb}
\PYG{p}{\PYGZcb{}}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}

\PYG{k+kd}{function} \PYG{n+nx}{load\PYGZus{}cb}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{p}{)} \PYG{p}{\PYGZob{}}
    \PYG{n+nx}{m\PYGZus{}data}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n+nx}{load}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{l+s+s2}{\PYGZdq{}some\PYGZus{}scene.json\PYGZdq{}}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}
\PYG{p}{\PYGZcb{}}

\PYG{n+nt}{\PYGZlt{}/script\PYGZgt{}}
\PYG{n+nt}{\PYGZlt{}/head\PYGZgt{}}

\PYG{n+nt}{\PYGZlt{}body} \PYG{n+na}{id=}\PYG{l+s}{\PYGZdq{}body\PYGZus{}id\PYGZdq{}}\PYG{n+nt}{\PYGZgt{}}\PYG{n+nt}{\PYGZlt{}/body\PYGZgt{}}

\PYG{n+nt}{\PYGZlt{}/html\PYGZgt{}}
\end{Verbatim}

In this case the \code{app} module creates a \code{\textless{}canvas\textgreater{}} element inside the \code{body\_id} container, inits the engine upon page loading and then calls the \code{load\_cb} callback.


\section{Module System}
\label{developers:id4}
While the engine gives an app programmer an API in the scale of dozens of modules, it occupies a single \code{b4w} namespace. To call a module's method import it first with the \code{b4w.require} function.

It is possible to register external modules if their names do not collide with already existing modules. A module can be registered with a \code{b4w.register} call. Check if a module with some name already exists with a \code{b4w.module\_check} call.

Example:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYG{c+c1}{// check if module exists}
\PYG{k}{if} \PYG{p}{(}\PYG{n+nx}{b4w}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n+nx}{module\PYGZus{}check}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{l+s+s2}{\PYGZdq{}my\PYGZus{}module\PYGZdq{}}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{)}
    \PYG{k}{throw} \PYG{l+s+s2}{\PYGZdq{}Failed to register module: my\PYGZus{}module\PYGZdq{}}\PYG{p}{;}

\PYG{c+c1}{// register my\PYGZus{}module}
\PYG{n+nx}{b4w}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n+nx}{register}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{l+s+s2}{\PYGZdq{}my\PYGZus{}module\PYGZdq{}}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{k+kd}{function}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{n+nx}{exports}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{n+nx}{require}\PYG{p}{)} \PYG{p}{\PYGZob{}}

    \PYG{c+c1}{// import module \PYGZdq{}version\PYGZdq{}}
    \PYG{k+kd}{var} \PYG{n+nx}{m\PYGZus{}version} \PYG{o}{=} \PYG{n+nx}{require}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{l+s+s2}{\PYGZdq{}version\PYGZdq{}}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}

    \PYG{c+c1}{// export print\PYGZus{}build\PYGZus{}date() from module \PYGZdq{}my\PYGZus{}module\PYGZdq{}}
    \PYG{n+nx}{exports}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n+nx}{print\PYGZus{}build\PYGZus{}date} \PYG{o}{=} \PYG{k+kd}{function}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{p}{)} \PYG{p}{\PYGZob{}}
        \PYG{c+c1}{// exec function date() from module \PYGZdq{}version\PYGZdq{}}
        \PYG{n+nx}{console}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n+nx}{log}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{l+s+s2}{\PYGZdq{}Engine build date: \PYGZdq{}} \PYG{o}{+} \PYG{n+nx}{m\PYGZus{}version}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n+nx}{date}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}
    \PYG{p}{\PYGZcb{}}
\PYG{p}{\PYGZcb{}}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}

\PYG{c+c1}{// import module \PYGZdq{}my\PYGZus{}module\PYGZdq{}}
\PYG{k+kd}{var} \PYG{n+nx}{m\PYGZus{}my\PYGZus{}module} \PYG{o}{=} \PYG{n+nx}{b4w}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n+nx}{require}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{l+s+s2}{\PYGZdq{}my\PYGZus{}module\PYGZdq{}}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}

\end{Verbatim}


\section{Moving Objects}
\label{developers:id5}
\begin{notice}{note}{Note:}
Make sure that the object you are trying to move is a {\hyperref[objects:static-dynamic-objects]{\emph{dynamic object}}}.
\end{notice}

Use the following methods of the \emph{transform} module to move objects in the engine:
\begin{description}
\item[{\emph{get\_translation}}] \leavevmode
Get the coordinates of the object's center. The option with a single argument returns a new vector (non-optimized option) while the option with two arguments requires an additional vector to write the result down.

\item[{\emph{get\_rotation}}] \leavevmode
Get the object's rotation quaternion. There are two ways of calling this function similar to \emph{get\_translation}.

\item[{\emph{get\_scale}}] \leavevmode
Get the object's scale.

\item[{\emph{set\_translation, set\_translation\_v}}] \leavevmode
Move the object's center into the specified location. The first function takes separate coordinates as arguments while the second one takes a three-component vector (Array or Float32Array).

\item[{\emph{set\_rotation, set\_rotation\_v}}] \leavevmode
Set the object's rotation quaternion. The first function takes separate coordinates as arguments while the second one takes a four-component vector (Array or Float32Array).

\item[{\emph{set\_scale}}] \leavevmode
Set the object's scale. One corresponds to the object's original state. Values less than one mean scaling down, more than one - scaling up. Note that not all objects can be scaled. Particularly scaling is not allowed for physics objects.

\item[{\emph{set\_rotation\_euler, set\_rotation\_euler\_v}}] \leavevmode
Set the object's rotation using Euler angles. An \textbf{intrinsic} YZX rotation system is used (that means the angles follow in the YZX order and the origin of coordinates rotates and takes up a new position for every angle).

\end{description}

\index{quaternion}

\section{Quaternions}
\label{developers:id6}\label{developers:index-0}
Quaternion is a four-component vector used to perform rotating. Quaternions have a number of advantages over other rotation methods such as:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
A quaternion isn't ambiguant and doesn't depend on the rotation order as the Euler angles.

\item {} 
Quaternion's memory usage is more effective (2-4 times less depending on the matrix used).

\item {} 
Better computing efficiency than for matrices in case of a series of rotations.

\item {} 
Numeric stability - compensation for multiplication errors arising from float number inaccuracy.

\item {} 
Convenient interpolation method.

\end{itemize}
\begin{description}
\item[{Quaternions have some drawbacks:}] \leavevmode\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
Rotating a vector with a quaternion is more computationally expensive than rotating with a matrix.

\item {} 
It is difficult to use quaternions for non-rotation transformations (such as perspective or orthogonal projection).

\end{itemize}

\end{description}

The engine has a number of functions to make it more convenient to work with quaternions:
\begin{description}
\item[{\emph{quat.multiply}}] \leavevmode
Quaternion multiplication. Note that left-multiplying A quaternion by B quaternion A*B is a rotation by A. I.e. the object already has some rotation B which we supplement with a new rotation by A.

\item[{\emph{quat.setAxisAngle}}] \leavevmode
A quaternion is an alternative presentation of rotation by an arbitrary angle relative to the arbitrary axis (vector). Positive direction of rotation is defined as anticlockwise when viewing from the vector's end. For example the \code{quat.setAxisAngle({[}1, 0, 0{]}, Math.PI/2, quat)} call forms a quaternion which can be used for rotating the object by 90 degrees (anticlockwise if viewing from the X axis' end) relative to the X axis.

\item[{\emph{quat.slerp}}] \leavevmode
Spherical interpolation of quaternions. Used for smoothing the object's rotation and animation.

\item[{\emph{util.euler\_to\_quat, util.quat\_to\_euler}.}] \leavevmode
Сonversion from Euler angles and back.

\end{description}


\subsection{Example of working with quaternions}
\label{developers:id7}
We need to rotate the object by 60 degrees in a horizontal plane to the right. We have a model named ``Cessna'' in Blender.

{\hfill\includegraphics[width=1.000\linewidth]{aircraft.jpg}\hfill}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] 
\end{DUlineblock}

Lets save a reference to the object in the \textbf{aircraft} variable:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYG{k+kd}{var} \PYG{n+nx}{aircraft} \PYG{o}{=} \PYG{n+nx}{b4w}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n+nx}{scenes}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n+nx}{get\PYGZus{}object\PYGZus{}by\PYGZus{}name}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{l+s+s2}{\PYGZdq{}Cessna\PYGZdq{}}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}
\end{Verbatim}

Lets rotate it:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
The orientation of coordinate axes is different in Blender and in the engine. Upon export there will be a transformation {[}X Y Z{]} (Blender) -\textgreater{} {[}X -Z Y{]} (the engine). Therefore we need to rotate the object relative to the Y axis and not the Z axis.

\item {} 
A clockwise rotation corresponds to the rotation to the right (i.e. in the negative direction).

\item {} 
60 degrees = \(\pi/3\) radians.

\end{itemize}

As a result we get:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYG{c+c1}{// compose quaternion}

\section{Event-Driven Model}
\label{developers:id8}\label{developers:event-model}
The event-driven model provides a universal interface for describing the 3D scene's change of state. It simpifies the processing of physics events and user actions.

\index{sensor}\index{sensor}

\subsection{Sensors}
\label{developers:index-1}\label{developers:id9}
The basic unit of the event-driven model is a sensor. A sensor is a programming entity and can only be active (1, one) or inactive (0, zero). Some sensors may carry a payload. For example the ray-tracing sensor (Ray Sensor) provides the relative length of the intersection ray.

\index{sensor!manifold}\index{sensor!manifold}
Users cannot directly control sensors via the external API. Instead all sensors must be present in one or multiple collections - so called sensor manifolds. A manifold is a logic container associated with a scene object. It generates a response to a defined set of sensor events by executing a callback function. To define the manifold it is required to have the following information (see also the API documenation for decription of the \code{controls.create\_sensor\_manifold()} function):
\begin{itemize}
\item {}

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Example}
\label{developers:id10}
Lets consider the task to insonify the impact of a thrown stone. A distinctive sound should be produced for impacting different media (for example terrain and wall). There are collision meshes with physical materials in the Blender scene, material ids are ``TERRAIN'' and ``WALL''. There is also a physical object being thrown in the scene, the object is named ``Stone''.

Lets define a collision sensor for each medium, by the type of the sound produced.

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYG{c+c1}{// import the modules}
\PYG{k+kd}{var} \PYG{n+nx}{m\PYGZus{}scenes} \PYG{o}{=} \PYG{n+nx}{b4w}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n+nx}{require}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{l+s+s2}{\PYGZdq{}scenes\PYGZdq{}}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}

\PYG{c+c1}{// create the sensors}
\PYG{k+kd}{var} \PYG{n+nx}{sensor\PYGZus{}impact\PYGZus{}terrain} \PYG{o}{=} \PYG{n+nx}{m\PYGZus{}controls}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n+nx}{create\PYGZus{}collision\PYGZus{}sensor}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{n+nx}{stone}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{l+s+s2}{\PYGZdq{}TERRAIN\PYGZdq{}}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}
\PYG{k+kd}{var} \PYG{n+nx}{sensor\PYGZus{}impact\PYGZus{}wall}    \PYG{o}{=} \PYG{n+nx}{m\PYGZus{}controls}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n+nx}{create\PYGZus{}collision\PYGZus{}sensor}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{n+nx}{stone}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{l+s+s2}{\PYGZdq{}WALL\PYGZdq{}}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}
\end{Verbatim}

Add the sensors into an array. Use the OR logic in the logic function. Place the sound processing code in the callback function. Create the sensor manifold with the ``IMPACT'' id and the CT\_SHOT type.

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYG{c+c1}{// array of the sensors}
\PYG{k+kd}{var} \PYG{n+nx}{impact\PYGZus{}sens\PYGZus{}array} \PYG{o}{=} \PYG{p}{[}\PYG{n+nx}{sensor\PYGZus{}impact\PYGZus{}terrain}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{n+nx}{sensor\PYGZus{}impact\PYGZus{}wall}\PYG{p}{]}\PYG{p}{;}

\end{Verbatim}

When the ``Stone'' object collides with any physical material of ``TERRAIN'' or ``WALL'', the callback function is executed. Inside this function we get the values of both sensors by their indices in the sensor array (0 - ``TERRAIN'', 1 - ``WALL''). The sensor value = 1 (active) means that the collision happened with the corresponding physical material. As a result the corresponding sound is produced (the code is not shown).

\section{Quality Profiles}
\label{developers:id11}\label{developers:quality-settings}
Several quality profiles are implemented in order to support platforms with different functionality.
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\emph{low quality} (P\_LOW) - a range of functions is turned off (such as shadows, dynamic reflection, postprocessing), the size of textures is halved when using a release version, anti-aliasing is disabled

\item {} 
\emph{high quality} (P\_HIGH) - all features requested by the scene are used, the anti-aliasing method is FXAA

\item {} 
\emph{maximum quality} (P\_ULTRA) - rendering resolution is doubled, resolution of shadow maps is increased, the anti-aliasing method is SMAA

\end{itemize}

{\hfill\includegraphics[width=1.000\linewidth]{quality.jpg}\hfill}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] 
\end{DUlineblock}

Switching the quality profiles can be performed in runtime before initialization of the WebGL context. The default profile is P\_HIGH.

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYG{k+kd}{var} \PYG{n+nx}{m\PYGZus{}cfg} \PYG{o}{=} \PYG{n+nx}{b4w}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{n+nx}{require}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{l+s+s2}{\PYGZdq{}config\PYGZdq{}}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}

\end{Verbatim}

Application developers can also set the \textbf{quality} parameter upon engine initialization using the \code{app.js} addon:

\chapter{For Engine Developers}
\label{developers_advanced:developers-advanced}\label{developers_advanced::doc}\label{developers_advanced:id1}

\section{Coding Style}
\label{developers_advanced:coding-style}\label{developers_advanced:id2}
This engine uses structural programming. The code is organized in modules. OOP methods are not used, classes are not defined, inheritance is not performed and so on.

The \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1\_true\_brace\_style\#K.26R\_style}{K\&R style} is used except for the fact that the opening bracket for a compound operator is placed on the same line, for example:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYG{k+kd}{function} \PYG{n+nx}{foo\PYGZus{}bar}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{p}{)} \PYG{p}{\PYGZob{}}
    \PYG{c+c1}{// ...}
\PYG{p}{\PYGZcb{}}

\PYG{k}{if} \PYG{p}{(}\PYG{n+nx}{a} \PYG{o}{\PYGZgt{}} \PYG{n+nx}{b}\PYG{p}{)} \PYG{p}{\PYGZob{}}
    \PYG{c+c1}{// ...}
\PYG{p}{\PYGZcb{}}
\end{Verbatim}

4 spaces are used for identation (no tabs allowed).


\subsection{Examples}
\label{developers_advanced:id3}
The underscore symbol is used in function and variable names:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYG{k+kd}{var} \PYG{n+nx}{foo\PYGZus{}bar} \PYG{o}{=} \PYG{l+m+mi}{123}\PYG{p}{;}  \PYG{c+c1}{// correct}
\PYG{k+kd}{var} \PYG{n+nx}{fooBar} \PYG{o}{=} \PYG{l+m+mi}{123}\PYG{p}{;}   \PYG{c+c1}{// wrong}
\end{Verbatim}

All global variables begin with an underscore:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYG{k+kd}{var} \PYG{n+nx}{\PYGZus{}foo\PYGZus{}bar} \PYG{o}{=} \PYG{k+kc}{null}\PYG{p}{;}
\end{Verbatim}

The constants are written in capital letters and never begin with an underscore:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYG{k+kd}{var} \PYG{n+nx}{FOO\PYGZus{}BAR} \PYG{o}{=} \PYG{l+m+mi}{100}\PYG{p}{;}
\end{Verbatim}

To avoid obfuscation the names of external API methods and properties are written as strings:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYG{n+nx}{exports}\PYG{p}{[}\PYG{l+s+s2}{\PYGZdq{}FOO\PYGZus{}BAR\PYGZdq{}}\PYG{p}{]} \PYG{o}{=} \PYG{l+m+mi}{123}\PYG{p}{;}

\PYG{n+nx}{exports}\PYG{p}{[}\PYG{l+s+s2}{\PYGZdq{}foo\PYGZus{}bar\PYGZdq{}}\PYG{p}{]} \PYG{o}{=} \PYG{k+kd}{function}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{p}{)} \PYG{p}{\PYGZob{}}

\PYG{p}{\PYGZcb{}}
\end{Verbatim}

Commenting is in English only. Comment style - JSDoc.


\section{Building the Addon}
\label{developers_advanced:id4}
Binary Blend4Web addon builds are available for the following platforms: Linux x32/64, OS X x64, Windows x32/64. At the same time users can compile the addon by themselves.

To do this Python 3.x (it's better if it's the same version as in Blender) and a C compiler are required. Under Linux it's enough to install the python3-dev and build-essential packages.
\begin{description}
\item[{Paths relative to the repository root:}] \leavevmode\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
building script: \code{./csrc/b4w\_bin/build.py}

\item {} 
Blend4Web addon: \code{./external/blender\_scripts/addons/blend4web/}

\end{itemize}

\end{description}

The building process is started in the following way:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
python3 ./csrc/b4w\PYGZus{}bin/build.py
\end{Verbatim}

As a result of the building you'll get a binary file called:

\code{b4w\_bin\_{[}PLATFORM{]}\_{[}ARCHITECTURE{]}.{[}STANDARD\_EXTENSION{]}},

located in the same directory as the addon. Example: \code{b4w\_bin\_Linux\_64.so}. After this the addon is ready to use under this platform.


\section{Dependencies}
\label{developers_advanced:dependencies}\label{developers_advanced:id5}
In order to effectively develop the engine and the applications a number of third party programs is neccessary (so called dependencies). The majority of these dependencies are part of modern GNU/Linux distributions such as Ubuntu. Under other Unix-like systems (Apple OS X, FreeBSD) installing them from source codes or from other sources is not a problem.

All dependencies are listed in the table below in order of decreasing importance.

\section{How to Name Functions and Variables}
\label{developers_advanced:id6}
When creating new functions and variables it is recommended to use the following prefixes and suffixes.
\begin{description}
\item[{\emph{init\_}}] \leavevmode
create an abstract object

\item[{\emph{create\_}}] \leavevmode
create a certain object

\item[{\emph{update\_}}] \leavevmode
update the state of an existing object

\item[{\emph{attach\_/detach\_}}] \leavevmode
add/remove a temporary object property

\item[{\emph{append\_/remove\_}}] \leavevmode
add/remove a temporary property to the already existing properies of the same kind

\item[{\emph{insert\_/pop\_}}] \leavevmode
add/remove an array element (accessed by index)

\item[{\emph{apply\_/clear\_}}] \leavevmode
operation with flags, binary values or arbitrary parameters

\item[{\emph{set\_/get\_}}] \leavevmode
set/get the property/variable value

\item[{\emph{\_tmp}}] \leavevmode
global variable - cache in the form of a simple object (array, vector)

\item[{\emph{\_cache}}] \leavevmode
global variable - cache in the form of a complex object

\end{description}


\section{Debugging}
\label{developers_advanced:debugging}\label{developers_advanced:id7}
Engine debugging is performed with the \code{debug.js} module methods.

The structure of the current render graph can be saved in the DOT format using the \code{b4w.debug.scenegraph\_to\_dot()} call, for example, in the browser console. After calling this method save the console's output into the file with the .gv extension. To get the graph in a visual form the \href{http://www.graphviz.org/}{graphviz} utilities are required. Converting to the SVG format is performed using the command:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZgt{} dot \PYGZhy{}Tsvg graph.gv \PYGZhy{}o graph.svg
\end{Verbatim}

where \code{graph.gv} is the name of the file with the saved graph.


\section{Shaders}
\label{developers_advanced:shaders}\label{developers_advanced:id8}
\index{shader obfuscator}

\subsection{Obfuscator}
\label{developers_advanced:index-0}\label{developers_advanced:id9}
The shaders used in the engine are converted with an obfuscator. In order to perform the obfuscation it is required to run one of the following commnads in the repository root:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\textbf{make} \emph{compile\_shaders} - check, obfuscate and export the shaders

\item {} 
\textbf{make} \emph{verify\_shaders} - only check and obfuscate the shaders

\end{itemize}

The obfuscator minifies the GLSL code, optimizes it and makes it diffucult to understand it. So far the following procedures are implemented:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
removing excessive space symbols, line brakes and repetitive '';'' symbols

\item {} 
replacing the user ids with shorter single-symboled, two-symboled etc names

\item {} 
outputting warnings about unused variables and functions (dead code)

\item {} 
checking the shader syntax

\item {} 
supporting the import/export mechanism and checking the shaders for the conformance with it

\end{itemize}

Syntax analysis (parsing) of the shader text is first performed during obfuscation. The corresponding parser is created automatically based on the grammar with the \href{http://pegjs.majda.cz/}{PEG.js} generator. Then the shaders are optimized and validated according to the parser data, and after that the shaders are exported in the form of an abstract syntax tree (AST) for direct loading into the engine.

The location of the main files in the repository:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
initial grammar - glsl\_utils/pegjs/glsl\_parser.pegjs

\item {} 
parser generation script - glsl\_utils/pegjs/gen\_nodejs.sh

\item {} 
parser - glsl\_utils/compiler/glsl\_parser.js

\end{itemize}

\index{shader obfuscator!import/export directives}

\subsection{import/export directives}
\label{developers_advanced:index-1}\label{developers_advanced:import-export}
import/export directives are used to organize, structure and increase the readability of the shader code in the include file. They are specified in the beginning of the file and should look approximately like this:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYG{c+cp}{\PYGZsh{}import u\PYGZus{}frame\PYGZus{}factor u\PYGZus{}quatsb u\PYGZus{}quatsa u\PYGZus{}transb u\PYGZus{}transa a\PYGZus{}influence}
\PYG{c+cp}{\PYGZsh{}import qrot}

\PYG{c+cp}{\PYGZsh{}export skin}
\end{Verbatim}

The \code{\#import} directive defines a set of ids which are declared outside the include file but can be accessed from inside it. There is a limitation though: such ids must necessarily be declared somewhere above the place where the include file is linked.

The \code{\#export} directive defines a set of ids which can be accessed from outside this file. Such ids must necessarily be declared in this file.

Therefore the shader which uses the include file must have all the declarations necessary for import before the place of linking, and can use the exported ids after it.

Ids can be both variable names and function names. If there are no import/export directives it's considered by default that the include file does not use external declarations and does not allow the using of internal ones.

\index{shader obfuscator!limitations}

\subsection{Recommendations and limitations for obfuscation}
\label{developers_advanced:id10}\label{developers_advanced:index-2}
Because of the following reasons: preprocessing, the need to process multiple shaders and include files and due to the obfuscator's features - its possible to garantee the work of the output code only if a number of rules and limitations are respected relative to the shader source code.
\begin{enumerate}
\item {} 
In order to describe constants which are defined by the engine at run, it's neccessary to use the \code{\#var} special directive. For example:

\end{enumerate}

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYG{c+cp}{\PYGZsh{}var AU\PYGZus{}QUALIFIER uniform}
\PYG{n}{AU\PYGZus{}QUALIFIER} \PYG{k}{float} \PYG{n}{a}\PYG{p}{;}
\end{Verbatim}

The syntax here is similar to the \#define directive. The point of the \#var directive is that the value which it defines allows to parse the initial shader. It's irrelevant what exactly it will be (e.g. `uniform' or `attribute' in the above example), because at this level it's unknown anyway. Nevertheless it's better to specify a more or less suitable description and not something arbitrary.

\begin{notice}{note}{Note:}
The \#var directive is not necessary for constants used not in the shader code but in the preprocessor expressions.
\end{notice}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item {} 
Using the import/export directives when needed.

\item {} 
The built-in functions must not be overloaded - only the user ones.

\item {} 
Variables should not be declared with names of the built-in functions, or main (even if it doesn't lead to errors).

\item {} 
The \#var and \#define directives must not be used for replacing single symbols in such operators as: ``++'', ``--'', ``*='', ``/='', ``+='', ``-='', ``=='', ``\textless{}='', ``\textgreater{}='', ''!='', ``\&\&'', ``\textbar{}\textbar{}'', ``\textasciicircum{}\textasciicircum{}''.

\end{enumerate}

For example:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYG{c+cp}{\PYGZsh{}var EQUAL =}
\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{p}{.}
\PYG{n}{a} \PYG{o}{*}\PYG{n}{EQUAL} \PYG{n}{b}\PYG{p}{;}
\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{p}{.}
\end{Verbatim}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{5}
\item {} 
The usage of the \#include directive should not lead to ambiguity during the obfuscation of the include file. This can happen when multiple shaders are included into the same file and the above defined directives (like \#var or \#define) can have influence on any of them. Also it's better not to use undeclared functions and variables in the include file.

\item {} 
Multi-level includes or multiple inclusion of the same include into the same shader is not supported.

\item {} 
The shader's malfunction can also be caused by nontrivial using of preprocessing, for example, creating an invalid GLSL code:

\end{enumerate}

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYG{c+cp}{\PYGZsh{}if TYPE}
\PYG{k}{void} \PYG{n}{function1}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{p}{)} \PYG{p}{\PYGZob{}}
\PYG{c+cp}{\PYGZsh{}else}
\PYG{k}{void} \PYG{n}{function1}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{k}{int} \PYG{n}{i}\PYG{p}{)} \PYG{p}{\PYGZob{}}
\PYG{c+cp}{\PYGZsh{}endif}
    \PYG{p}{.}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{p}{.}
\PYG{p}{\PYGZcb{}}
\end{Verbatim}

\index{WebGL!extensions}

\subsection{WebGL extensions support}
\label{developers_advanced:webgl}\label{developers_advanced:index-3}
The obfuscator's functioning may depend on the WebGL extensions being used, if they somehow influence the shading language. At the moment the following extensions are supported:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
OES\_standard\_derivatives

\end{itemize}

\index{shader obfuscator!errors}

\chapter{Team Work. Using Git}
\label{git_short_manual:git-short-manual}\label{git_short_manual:index-0}\label{git_short_manual:git}\label{git_short_manual::doc}

\section{Overview}
\label{git_short_manual:what-is-git}\label{git_short_manual:id1}
In order to organize team work a git version control system can be used.

The git's main function is to save the history of changes with the possibility to roll back to prevoius versions. Another important function is syncronizing with automatic merging of changes.

Git is a distributed system and every developer or designer has his own local repository (storage). Syncing between the local repositories can be performed via the central (``shared'') storage, which can be located on a special machine (server). Access to the server can be organized through SSH protocol.


\section{Typical Workflow}
\label{git_short_manual:id2}\label{git_short_manual:git-pipeline}\begin{enumerate}
\item {} 
Files can be created, added or deleted during the work process in the local repositories.

\item {} 
After a certain logical period of work is finished it is necessary to fix (commit) the changes and/or syncronize with your team mates.

\item {} 
Files are prepared for commit i.e. the accounting of changed, new and deleted files and also the resetting of changes.

\item {} 
Commit is performed.

\item {} 
Local changes are uploaded into the shared storage and become available for the collegues.

\end{enumerate}

There are GUIs for git which provide a user interface for the commands. Nevertheless it's quite convenient to directly enter the git commands.

A limited set of git commands recommended for creating applications and graphical resources is described below.

It's necessary to switch to the repository before executing the commands, e.g.:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZgt{} \PYG{n+nb}{cd} \PYGZti{}/blend4web
\end{Verbatim}

\index{git!individual settings}

\section{Individual Settings}
\label{git_short_manual:id3}\label{git_short_manual:git-config}\label{git_short_manual:index-1}
A new user can set up his name and email using the commands:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZgt{} git config \PYGZhy{}\PYGZhy{}global user.name \PYGZdq{}Ivan Petrov\PYGZdq{}
\PYGZgt{} git config \PYGZhy{}\PYGZhy{}global user.email ipetrov@blend4web.com
\end{Verbatim}

The set up data will be used in the changelog.

\index{git!checking the status}

\section{Checking the Status}
\label{git_short_manual:git-example-begin}\label{git_short_manual:id4}\label{git_short_manual:index-2}
It's recommended to check the state of the repository before, in progress and after performing all the operations.

Use this command to check the status:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZgt{} git status
\end{Verbatim}

The result of the \code{git status} command if all the commits were performed and there are no new files:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZsh{} On branch master
\PYGZsh{} Your branch is ahead of \PYGZsq{}origin/master\PYGZsq{} by 2 commits.
\PYGZsh{}
nothing to commit (working directory clean)
\end{Verbatim}

Possible result of \code{git status} if there are changes. For example the \code{apps\_dev/firstperson/firstperson.js} and \code{doc\_src/git\_short\_manual.rst} files are changed and a new file \code{123.txt} is created:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZsh{} On branch master
\PYGZsh{} Changes not staged for commit:
\PYGZsh{}   (use \PYGZdq{}git add \PYGZlt{}file\PYGZgt{}...\PYGZdq{} to update what will be committed)
\PYGZsh{}   (use \PYGZdq{}git checkout \PYGZhy{}\PYGZhy{} \PYGZlt{}file\PYGZgt{}...\PYGZdq{} to discard changes in working directory)
\PYGZsh{}
\PYGZsh{}   modified:   apps\PYGZus{}dev/firstperson/firstperson.js
\PYGZsh{}   modified:   doc\PYGZus{}src/git\PYGZus{}short\PYGZus{}manual.rst
\PYGZsh{}
\PYGZsh{} Untracked files:
\PYGZsh{}   (use \PYGZdq{}git add \PYGZlt{}file\PYGZgt{}...\PYGZdq{} to include in what will be committed)
\PYGZsh{}
\PYGZsh{}   123.txt
no changes added to commit (use \PYGZdq{}git add\PYGZdq{} and/or \PYGZdq{}git commit \PYGZhy{}a\PYGZdq{})
\end{Verbatim}

\index{git!preparing for commit}

\section{Before the Commit}
\label{git_short_manual:id5}\label{git_short_manual:git-example-prepare-to-commit}\label{git_short_manual:index-3}

\subsection{Checking changes (of the text files)}
\label{git_short_manual:id6}
In case of text files it is recommended to view the introduced changes before performing the commit.

Check what was changed in the whole directory:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZgt{} git diff
\end{Verbatim}

or in a specific file only:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZgt{} git diff apps\PYGZus{}dev/firstperson/firstperson.js
\end{Verbatim}

A possible result of the \code{git diff} command for a text file:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
diff \PYGZhy{}\PYGZhy{}git a/apps\PYGZus{}dev/firstperson/firstperson.js b/apps\PYGZus{}dev/firstperson/firstperson.js
index 4381c99..44b3b15 100644

             b4w.camera.translate\PYGZus{}view(obj, 0, cam\PYGZus{}view\PYGZus{}down, cam\PYGZus{}view\PYGZus{}angle);

+        \PYGZcb{}
     \PYGZcb{}
\end{Verbatim}


\subsection{Rolling back files}
\label{git_short_manual:id7}
If the file was changed or deleted but it is necessary to recover it (to the latest commited state) use the command:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZgt{} git checkout doc\PYGZus{}src/git\PYGZus{}short\PYGZus{}manual.rst
\PYGZgt{} git checkout 123.txt
\end{Verbatim}

The introduced changes will be cancelled - this is why this command should be performed with caution.


\subsection{Unwanted files}
\label{git_short_manual:id8}
If a file is listed in the \code{Untracked files} (\code{git status}), but version control is not needed for it, it should be deleted or moved beyond the working directory.

\index{git!adding and removing files}

\section{Preparing for Commit}
\label{git_short_manual:index-4}\label{git_short_manual:git-example-add-rm-commit}\label{git_short_manual:id9}

\subsection{Adding files}
\label{git_short_manual:id10}
If you are happy with the changes, add the needed changed and/or new files for commit.

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZgt{} git add apps\PYGZus{}dev/firstperson/firstperson.js
\PYGZgt{} git add 123.txt
\end{Verbatim}

Check the status again:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZgt{} git status
\end{Verbatim}

Possible result of the \code{git status} command after adding some files with the \code{git add} command:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZsh{} On branch master
\PYGZsh{} Changes to be committed:
\PYGZsh{}   (use \PYGZdq{}git reset HEAD \PYGZlt{}file\PYGZgt{}...\PYGZdq{} to unstage)
\PYGZsh{}
\PYGZsh{}   new file:   123.txt
\PYGZsh{}   modified:   apps\PYGZus{}dev/firstperson/firstperson.js
\PYGZsh{}
\PYGZsh{} Changes not staged for commit:
\PYGZsh{}   (use \PYGZdq{}git add \PYGZlt{}file\PYGZgt{}...\PYGZdq{} to update what will be committed)
\PYGZsh{}   (use \PYGZdq{}git checkout \PYGZhy{}\PYGZhy{} \PYGZlt{}file\PYGZgt{}...\PYGZdq{} to discard changes in working directory)
\PYGZsh{}
\PYGZsh{}   modified:   doc\PYGZus{}src/git\PYGZus{}short\PYGZus{}manual.rst
\PYGZsh{}
\end{Verbatim}

You can see that the \code{apps\_dev/firstperson/firstperson.js} and \code{123.txt} files were added for commit and the \code{doc\_src/git\_short\_manual.rst} file was not added. To make things easier it is recommended to either add such files for commit or cancel their changes with the \code{git checkout} command.


\subsection{Removing files}
\label{git_short_manual:id11}
Some files can be marked as deleted from git after performing the \code{git status} command, for example:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZsh{} On branch master
\PYGZsh{} Your branch is ahead of \PYGZsq{}origin/master\PYGZsq{} by 2 commits.
\PYGZsh{}
\PYGZsh{} Changes not staged for commit:
\PYGZsh{}   (use \PYGZdq{}git add/rm \PYGZlt{}file\PYGZgt{}...\PYGZdq{} to update what will be committed)
\PYGZsh{}   (use \PYGZdq{}git checkout \PYGZhy{}\PYGZhy{} \PYGZlt{}file\PYGZgt{}...\PYGZdq{} to discard changes in working directory)
\PYGZsh{}
\PYGZsh{}   deleted:    123.txt
\PYGZsh{}
no changes added to commit (use \PYGZdq{}git add\PYGZdq{} and/or \PYGZdq{}git commit \PYGZhy{}a\PYGZdq{})
\end{Verbatim}

In this case if deleting the file should be recorded (i.e. enter the commit), perform the \code{git rm} command, for example:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZgt{} git rm 123.txt
\end{Verbatim}

If the file was deleted by accident and its necessary to recover it, use the \code{git checkout} command.

\index{git!commit}

\section{Commit}
\label{git_short_manual:git-commit}\label{git_short_manual:index-5}\label{git_short_manual:id12}
Perform commit with the command:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZgt{} git commit
\end{Verbatim}

A text editor window will show up (for example, \textbf{nano} or \textbf{vim}), in which it's nesessary to enter the commit comment in English.

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
  GNU nano 2.2.6                                    File: .git/COMMIT\PYGZus{}EDITMSG

\end{Verbatim}

Save the changes and quit the editor (in \textbf{nano} Ctrl+O, then Ctrl+X; in \textbf{vim} ZZ, or ESC :wq).

After commit it's recommended to recheck the status. Commit is performed correctly if the \code{git status} command returns \code{nothing to commit, working directory clean}.

\section{Syncing Between Repositories}
\label{git_short_manual:id13}\label{git_short_manual:index-6}\label{git_short_manual:git-example-repo-sync}

\subsection{From the remote - to the local}
\label{git_short_manual:id14}
After all the commits are performed it's nesessary to load the changes from the remote (``shared'') repository to the local one:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZgt{} git pull
\end{Verbatim}

Result of the \code{git pull} command if there are no changes in the remote repository:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]

If you wish it's possible to look up the changes made by your collegues using the following command:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZgt{} git diff dbf3877..9f9700c
\end{Verbatim}

The parameter of this command - in this case dbf3877..9f9700c - shows between which commits exactly the changes were made. This parameter can be conveniently selected in the console in the \code{git pull} results and pasted with a mouse click (middle button) where you need.

You can also view the changelog:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZgt{} git log
\end{Verbatim}

The result of the \code{git push} command if synchronization was not successful because the \code{git pull} command was not executed first:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
To gfxteam@lixer:blend4web.git
 ! [rejected]        master \PYGZhy{}\PYGZgt{} master (non\PYGZhy{}fast\PYGZhy{}forward)
error: failed to push some refs to \PYGZsq{}gfxteam@lixer:blend4web.git\PYGZsq{}
To prevent you from losing history, non\PYGZhy{}fast\PYGZhy{}forward updates were rejected
Merge the remote changes (e.g. \PYGZsq{}git pull\PYGZsq{}) before pushing again.  See the
\PYGZsq{}Note about fast\PYGZhy{}forwards\PYGZsq{} section of \PYGZsq{}git push \PYGZhy{}\PYGZhy{}help\PYGZsq{} for details.
\end{Verbatim}

You should execute the \code{git pull} command.

The changes uploaded into the central repository can be received by other developers with the \code{git pull} command.

\index{git!resolving conflicts}

\section{Resolving Conflicts}
\label{git_short_manual:index-7}\label{git_short_manual:id16}

\subsection{Overview}
\label{git_short_manual:id17}
Synchronization conflicts occur if both conditions are met
\begin{enumerate}
\item {} 
the same file was changed both in the local and remote repositories, and

\item {} 
automatic merging of the changes didn't occur because the changes are in the same place of the file.

\end{enumerate}

Typical cases:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {} 
a binary file (texture, blend file) was independently changed by two developers

\item {} 
different changes were introduced to the same line of the same text file

\item {} 
one developer has changed the file while the other has moved it and so on.

\end{enumerate}

Although synchronization conflicts are normal, if they happen too often it slows down the work. It is recommended to notify your team mates about start of working with the shared binary files, and also to perform synchronization more often. It is nesessary to effectively distribute the work between developers to reduce the number of such shared files. This can be achieved particularly through linking of all the scene's resources from the separate blend files into the master file.


\subsection{The steps to be taken}
\label{git_short_manual:id18}
It's not recommended to perform any files operations (modifying, deleting) while the repository is in a conflict state.

The first thing to do is to perform the \code{git status} command.

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZsh{} On branch master
\PYGZsh{} Your branch and \PYGZsq{}origin/master\PYGZsq{} have diverged,
\PYGZsh{} and have 7 and 1 different commit each, respectively.
\PYGZsh{}
\PYGZsh{} Unmerged paths:
\PYGZsh{}   (use \PYGZdq{}git add/rm \PYGZlt{}file\PYGZgt{}...\PYGZdq{} as appropriate to mark resolution)
\PYGZsh{}
\PYGZsh{}   both modified:      external/blender/landscape\PYGZus{}objects/Fallen\PYGZus{}tree.blend
\PYGZsh{}
no changes added to commit (use \PYGZdq{}git add\PYGZdq{} and/or \PYGZdq{}git commit \PYGZhy{}a\PYGZdq{})
\end{Verbatim}

A list of conflicting files can be found in the \code{Unmerged paths} section.

The order of the following steps is different for binary and text files.


\subsection{Binary files}
\label{git_short_manual:id19}
At this stage the conflicting binary files are in the same state as they were in the local repository before the synchronization attempt. The files are fully functional (for example they can be opened by graphics editors).

In case of conflicting binary files it's necessary to sort out (with the team mates or by yourself) which of the files should be left and which should be discarded. Selecting can be performed with the \code{git checkout} command.

Select the local version of the file (\textbf{- -ours}). To make sure that it's local you can open it.

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZgt{} git checkout \PYGZhy{}\PYGZhy{}ours external/blender/landscape\PYGZus{}objects/Fallen\PYGZus{}tree.blend
\end{Verbatim}

Select the remote version of the file (\textbf{- -theirs}). To make sure that it's remote you can open it.

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZgt{} git checkout \PYGZhy{}\PYGZhy{}theirs external/blender/landscape\PYGZus{}objects/Fallen\PYGZus{}tree.blend
\end{Verbatim}

Select the local version of the file again (\textbf{- -ours}).

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZgt{} git checkout \PYGZhy{}\PYGZhy{}ours external/blender/landscape\PYGZus{}objects/Fallen\PYGZus{}tree.blend
\end{Verbatim}

Eventually you have to stick to the right version of the file. In case there is a threat of loosing the work you may save the discarded file outside the repository.


\subsection{Text files}
\label{git_short_manual:id20}
At this stage git introduces both local and remote changes to the conflicting text files, in a special format. Such text files are not workable as a rule.

Example. One developer changed the scene name from ``Blue Lizard'' to ``Green Lizard'' in the application file and uploaded the changes into the central repository. Another developer changed ``Blue Lizard'' to ``Red Lizard'' in the same line, performed commit and executed the \code{git pull} command. As a result this very developer will be responsible for resolving the conflict. The following lines will be present in his version of the application file:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZlt{}\PYGZlt{}\PYGZlt{}\PYGZlt{}\PYGZlt{}\PYGZlt{}\PYGZlt{} HEAD
                \PYGZdq{}name\PYGZdq{}: \PYGZdq{}Red Lizard\PYGZdq{},
=======
                \PYGZdq{}name\PYGZdq{}: \PYGZdq{}Green Lizard\PYGZdq{},
\PYGZgt{}\PYGZgt{}\PYGZgt{}\PYGZgt{}\PYGZgt{}\PYGZgt{}\PYGZgt{} 81bf4e2d5610d500ad4d2a2605ee7e61f759f201
\end{Verbatim}

In case of conflicting text files the following steps can be taken. Files with source code should be edited with or without respect to the changes introduced by both parties. On the other hand, it is easier to reexport the exported scene text files (ending with \textbf{.json}).


\subsection{Correcting commit}
\label{git_short_manual:id21}
After selecting the required files or editing the changes, add them for commit:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZgt{} git add external/blender/landscape\PYGZus{}objects/Fallen\PYGZus{}tree.blend
\PYGZgt{} git status
\end{Verbatim}

Possible result of \code{git status} command after adding the conflicting files for commit:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZsh{} On branch master
\PYGZsh{} Your branch and \PYGZsq{}origin/master\PYGZsq{} have diverged,
\PYGZsh{} and have 7 and 1 different commit each, respectively.
\PYGZsh{}
nothing to commit (working directory clean)
\end{Verbatim}

Perform commit. It is recommended to leave the default comment:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZgt{} git commit
\PYGZgt{} git status
\end{Verbatim}

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZsh{} On branch master
\PYGZsh{} Your branch is ahead of \PYGZsq{}origin/master\PYGZsq{} by 8 commits.
\PYGZsh{}
nothing to commit (working directory clean)
\end{Verbatim}

Conflicts are resolved, the changes from the remote repository are successfully applied in the local repository. Now the changes in the local repository - including the just resolved conflict - can be uploaded to the remote repository with the \code{git push} command.

\index{git!tags}

\section{Tags}
\label{git_short_manual:id22}\label{git_short_manual:index-8}\label{git_short_manual:git-tags}
Tags are intended for pointing at a certain commit, for example, to specify a stable product version.

View the list of tags:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZgt{} git tag
\end{Verbatim}

Create a tag for the release from June 3, 2013, pointing to the commit with a stable product version:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZgt{} git tag R130603 67bb597f7ed1643ed0220d57e894f28662e614e5
\end{Verbatim}

Check the commit tag information:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZgt{} git show \PYGZhy{}\PYGZhy{}shortstat R130603
\end{Verbatim}

Roll back to the tag...

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZgt{} git checkout R130603
\end{Verbatim}

...and return:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZgt{} git checkout master
\end{Verbatim}

Synchronize the tags with the remote repository:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZgt{} git push \PYGZhy{}\PYGZhy{}tags
\end{Verbatim}

Delete the tag (if created by mistake):

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZgt{} git tag \PYGZhy{}d R130603
\end{Verbatim}

\chapter{Problems and Solutions}
\label{problems_and_solutions:problems-and-solutions}\label{problems_and_solutions::doc}\label{problems_and_solutions:id1}

\section{Problems when Running the Renderer}
\label{problems_and_solutions:id2}\label{problems_and_solutions:renderer-not-working}
\emph{1. The ``Browser could not initialize WebGL'' message is shown}.

Follow the instructions listed in the {\hyperref[problems_and_solutions:webgl-not-working]{\emph{WebGL Failed to Init}}} section.

\emph{2. The user interface and background are shown but the default scene is not rendered (a cube with the logo). At the same time the} \href{http://get.webgl.org/}{http://get.webgl.org/} \emph{site and other WebGL applications are working correctly.}

Possible causes:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
The browser is not set up for loading local resources. See the {\hyperref[setup:browser-for-local-loading]{\emph{Setting up the Browser for Loading Local Resources}}} section.

\item {} 
The renderer tries to load resource files which were moved or deleted.

\item {} 
You are using a combination of browser/drivers/operating system which does not fully support WebGL (examples are: Internet Explorer 11 / MS Windows, open source drivers / Linux).

\end{itemize}


\section{WebGL Failed to Init}
\label{problems_and_solutions:webgl}\label{problems_and_solutions:webgl-not-working}
The \href{http://get.webgl.org/}{http://get.webgl.org/} page tells about problems when viewing it in recent Chrome or Firefox. What can I do?
\begin{enumerate}
\item {} 
Install the latest updates for your system (for MS Windows see \href{http://support.microsoft.com/kb/311047}{the guide}). In case of MS Windows install the latest \href{http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35}{DirectX runtime}. Reboot.

\item {} 
It is recommended to timely update video card drivers. To detect your video card and its vendor please type \textbf{about:gpu} to the address bar of Chrome browser...

\end{enumerate}

{\hfill\includegraphics[width=1.000\linewidth]{about_gpu_directx.jpg}\hfill}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] 
\end{DUlineblock}

or run the DirectX Diagnostic Tool called \textbf{dxdiag} (MS Windows only).

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] 
\end{DUlineblock}

{\hfill\includegraphics[width=1.000\linewidth]{dxdiag.jpg}\hfill}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] 
\end{DUlineblock}

Download the drivers from the corresponding support center (for example \href{http://downloadcenter.intel.com/Default.aspx}{Intel}, \href{http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx}{Nvidia}, \href{http://support.amd.com/en-us/download}{AMD/ATI}). Reboot the system after the drivers are installed.
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item {} 
If the measures described above did not help to initialize rendering (or there is no possibility to update the system) try to change the browser settings.

\end{enumerate}

\emph{For Chrome}:

Enter \textbf{about:flags} (or \textbf{chrome://flags/}) into the browser's address bar, click \code{Enable} under the \code{Override software rendering list} option and restart the browser.

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] 
\end{DUlineblock}

{\hfill\includegraphics[width=1.000\linewidth]{about_flags_force_webgl.jpg}\hfill}

\begin{DUlineblock}{0em}
\item[] 
\end{DUlineblock}

\emph{For Firefox}:

Enter \textbf{about:config} into the browser's address bar, search for the \code{webgl.force-enabled} parameter and double-click on it to switch from \code{false} to \code{true}.

{\hfill\includegraphics[width=1.000\linewidth]{about_config_force_webgl.jpg}\hfill}

\begin{notice}{note}{Note:}
For Linux users - due to incomplete OpenGL implementation in open source drivers at the moment it is recommended to use current versions of proprietary drivers for Nvidia and AMD video cards.
\end{notice}


\section{Using a Local Web Server}
\label{problems_and_solutions:local-web-server}\label{problems_and_solutions:web}
An easy way for viewing local resources in browsers is running the web server from the standard \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python\_(programming\_language)}{Python} library.

\emph{Under MS Windows}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {} 
Download and install the latest Python distribution from the \href{http://www.python.org/download/releases/}{official site}. The current version is 3.4 and by default it will be installed to the \code{Python34} directory on the \code{C} drive.

\item {} 
Run Command Prompt.

\item {} 
Enter the following commands:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZgt{} c:
\PYGZgt{} /Python34/python \PYGZhy{}m http.server
\end{Verbatim}

\item {} 
Open the \href{http://localhost:8000}{http://localhost:8000} page and select the required file for displaying.

\end{enumerate}

\emph{Under Linux}:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZgt{} python \PYGZhy{}m SimpleHTTPServer
\end{Verbatim}

or:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZgt{} python3 \PYGZhy{}m http.server
\end{Verbatim}

A port number can be specified by the additional parameter:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZgt{} python \PYGZhy{}m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
\end{Verbatim}
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\emph{genindex}

\item {} 
\emph{search}
